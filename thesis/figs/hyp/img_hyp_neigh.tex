\caption{
Performance of $MGTCOM^{\mathcal{E}}$ model with varying convolution layers. 
We vary the architecture by switching between Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) and Heterogenous GraphSAGE convolutional layers.
Similarly, we also modify the neighborhood size of each node within the two-layer convolution setup. 
Format $(x, y)$ represents the number of neighbors per node in the first ($x$) and second ($y$) layer respectively.
