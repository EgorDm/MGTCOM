    Visualization of a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer Layer. Given target node $t$ and neighboring source nodes $s_1$ and $s_2$ by edges $e_1$ and $e_2$, mutual attention and messages are computed. Within aggregation step the messages are attended and combined with previous target node embedding $H^{(l-1)}_t$ resulting in the new embedding vector $H^{(l)}_t$
