- [x] Look into https://graphia.app/
- [x] GraphML export script for Neo4j
- [x] Add smart schema overwrite (preserving existing properties)
- [x] Add preprocessing for other datasets
- [x] Figure out how to use timestamps in gephi
- [ ] Add docker configs and run scripts for baselines
- [ ] Add dataset export to edge list
- [ ] Find ground truth communities if applicable on current datasets
- [ ] Added baseline config format (and add configs)
- [ ] Add baseline benchmarking based on config
- [ ] Added W&B support for running baselines
- [ ] Add evaluation metrics to the baselines
- [ ] Add a way to visualize CD results
- [ ] Has cool visualizations [majortrack](https://majortrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme_include.html#synthetic-example)
- [ ] Implementation overlapping NMI - [LINK](https://github.com/ponxosio/pyonmi)
- [ ] Checkout R based DCD lib [LINK](https://github.com/softskillsgroup/DynComm-R-package)
- [ ] Run Static Community Detection on benchmark datasets
- [ ] Run Dynamic Community Detection on benchmark datasets
- [ ] Run Representation Learning on benchmark datasets
- [ ] Implement remaining DCD methods
- [ ] Check [Dynamo](https://github.com/nogrady/dynamo) is seems like a recent DCD 
- [ ] Check [Karate Club](https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lib. It has a few CD methods
