The illegitimate daughter to the famous Echani [[General/Legends|General]] [[Yusanis]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arren Kae]], both of whom fought in the [[Mandalorian Wars]], she later served along with her five half-sisters as the [[Handmaiden Sisters]] under Jedi Master [[Atris]] in the period following the [[Jedi Civil War]]. During her service to Atris at the [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]] on [[Telos IV]], Brianna met [[Meetra Surik]], also known as the Jedi Exile, and was subsequently tasked with accompanying her on her mission to seek out the [[Lost Jedi]], Jedi Masters who survived the [[First Jedi Purge]]. As Surik\\'s companion, Brianna helped battle against numerous adversaries, including the [[Sith Triumvirate]].\\n\\nDuring the journey, Brianna trained Surik in [[Echani (martial art)/Legends|Echani]] techniques and eventually received [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]] from Surik in return, becoming one of the [[Lost Jedi|first new members]] of the Jedi Order after the Purge. In accepting such training, however, she broke her oath to Atris. The Jedi Master labeled her a traitor, resulting in a confrontation between Brianna, her sisters and her former master. According to the predictions of [[Kreia]], Brianna would become instrumental in the reconstruction of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and succeed Atris as its lead [[Jedi historian]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n===Early life===\\n{{Quote|I knew her mother. She was a Jedi Knight&mdash;a master, named Arren Kae. Jedi are forbidden to have children, and when the crime finally came to light almost a decade later, Kae was exiled. She joined the Mandalorian Wars after the shame of her birth was revealed.|Kreia|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Briannafull.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brianna, the last handmaiden]]\\nBrianna was born in [[3976 BBY]]<ref name=\"age\" /> as the result of a forbidden union between [[General/Legends|General]] [[Yusanis]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arren Kae]]. Yusanis, a master [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] combatant of the Republic world [[Eshan/Legends|Eshan]], was married to another woman to whom he had five daughters, while Kae, as a member of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] was forbidden to form strong attachments. Despite these restrictions, the couple began a secret relationship, risking their status by continuing to meet. Despite Kae\\'s attempts to keep the affair and Brianna\\'s existence a secret, the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] eventually found out about the situation, and Kae was [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled from the Jedi Order]] as punishment.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nKae later chose to join her former apprentice, [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], to fight the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]], who were bent on [[Mandalorian Wars|conquering the Outer Rim]]. Yusanis joined them, despite the fact that he was responsible for the care of Brianna and his other five daughters. Yusanis and Kae became known as heroes of the conflict, but Kae eventually fell in battle, and Yusanis returned a broken man, abandoning battle to become a [[Senator/Legends|senator]]. He avoided speaking of Kae, leaving Brianna with no memories of her mother. Later, Yusanis\\'s old ally Revan declared himself the new [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and turned on the Jedi, starting the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He sought to weaken the Republic, and targeted the Republic worlds of [[Serroco]], [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] and [[Eshan/Legends|Eshan]] for destabilization. Revan accomplished his goals by assassinating a senator from each world, and the death of an Echani senator caught Yusanis\\' attention. When Yusanis found evidence of the act, he challenged Revan to a duel, but was ultimately slain by the Dark Lord, leaving Brianna an orphan.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSometime after Yusanis\\'s death, Brianna and her five half-sisters entered the service of Jedi Master [[Atris]], one of the few Masters who survived the Jedi Civil War. The Jedi Order had been greatly divided and weakened by the war, and further attacks by a resurgent [[Sith Triumvirate|Sith Order]] after the war\\'s conclusion left very few Jedi remaining. Atris hoped to revive the Jedi Order after most of the other Jedi Masters had been [[Conclave at Katarr|killed]] during one of these attacks on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]], and established a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|secret academy]] on [[Telos IV]], a planet that had been [[Bombing of Telos IV|devastated]] by Sith forces during the Jedi Civil War. The sisters joined her in the academy and agreed to serve as her [[handmaiden]]s, aiding Atris in gathering [[Holocron/Legends|Jedi artifacts]] from around the galaxy. At one point during their service, Brianna and her half-sisters swore an oath to Atris that they would never study the teachings of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], nor receive any [[Jedi training/Legends|instruction]] from a Jedi; although Brianna was the only handmaiden who had any [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitivity]] due to her heritage. While Atris knew of Brianna\\'s familial lineage, as well as her sensitivity, she never mentioned Brianna\\'s potential, and the handmaiden remained ignorant of her innate abilities.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nThe offspring of Echani parents appeared to non-Echani to look identical to their parents, typically the one of the same [[Gender/Legends|sex]]. As such, Brianna resembled her Jedi mother and not Yusanis\\' original wife, which distinguished her from her sisters as physical evidence of their father\\'s affair. Her father\\'s infidelity had brought shame on himself; and, after his death at the hands of Revan, that shame was thrust upon her, as the Echani believed that betrayal and shame were passed down through bloodlines. Despite working hard to disprove this stigma that followed her all through her young life, Brianna was branded the \"Last of the Handmaidens\" by her sisters, meaning she was the least of them, in terms of worth and combat ability. As a result, Brianna felt she was unworthy of bearing any signs of individuality and renounced her name in favor of her title.<ref name=\"TSL\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\">\\'\\'[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\n===Meetra Surik\\'s arrival===\\n{{Quote|I will not warn you again. Drop your weapons, or we shall take them from you.|Brianna to Meetra Surik upon the latter\\'s arrival at the Academy.|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_Hawk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Security feed showing Brianna boarding the Ebon Hawk]]\\nThe Jedi Academy was secluded in the isolated polar regions of Telos IV, and consequently, the academy remained unnoticed, even when the Republic began the [[Telosian Restoration Project]] in an effort to restore the ecosystem of the devastated planet. The project was headed by the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Chodo Habat]] and his [[Chodo Habat\\'s herd|herd]], and a massive [[Citadel Station|space station]] was built in orbit as a staging area for the project. When Atris later learned that the planet [[Peragus II]], the main source of the station\\'s fuel had been destroyed and that the [[Telos Security Force]] was holding [[Meetra Surik|suspects]] in the planet\\'s destruction, who had recently arrived in the system, she ordered Brianna to investigate. Acting covertly, Brianna sneaked onto Citadel Station and stole the suspects\\' ship, the \\'\\'[[Ebon Hawk]]\\'\\', as well as their droid, [[T3-M4]], which was aboard as a result of the ship being impounded after arriving at Citadel Station shortly after the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction of]] Peragus II. Brianna then brought the ship to the secret academy where Atris hoped to look into the events surrounding the destruction of the planet. Atris was unaware that the new owner of the ship was a former friend from the Jedi Order,<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Meetra Surik,<ref name=\"revan\">\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'</ref> also known as the Jedi Exile, another hero of the Mandalorian Wars who was exiled for her defiance of the Jedi Council and her decision to join Revan in the war. Surik was released from custody when it was discovered that Peragus II had been destroyed as a result of her escape from the Sith Lord [[Darth Sion]], and she began a search for her stolen ship.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSurik, along with companions [[Kreia]] and [[Atton Rand]], whom she had met on Peragus II, eventually located the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] with some help from a [[Bao-Dur|technician]] of the Restoration Project and entered the academy. Brianna, flanked by two of her sisters, confronted the group and demanded their surrender. Surik agreed so as to avoid a conflict, and Brianna escorted her to meet with Atris. Atris had been one of the masters who decided on Surik\\'s punishment for her involvement in the Mandalorian Wars, and was not pleased to see her again. After a charged discussion over Surik\\'s seeming unrepentant attitude towards her actions in defying the Council, she informed Atris of the Sith\\'s involvement in the destruction of Peragus II, and offered her aid. Atris suggested she seek out the other surviving Jedi Masters and gather them at the ruined Enclave on Dantooine in order to form a plan of action, and sent Surik away. Brianna was startled to have seen her mistress become so volatile, strengthening her growing belief that the Jedi were not the passionless beings Atris had described them to be.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBefore Surik departed Telos, Brianna was able to speak to her in private. Brianna was wary of Surik at first, but began to speak more freely when Surik managed to convince her that, contrary to Atris\\'s opinion, she had not turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] during the Mandalorian Wars. Brianna confessed that she was the only one of her sisters who did not doubt Surik\\'s battle prowess and was more receptive to Surik\\'s opinion. Brianna also mentioned how she was often distracted by the [[Jedi artifact/Legends|Jedi teachings]] Atris had rescued and stored at the academy; and, as a result, was eager to learn about life as a Jedi. She asked about various details of a Jedi\\'s life, including the issue of attachment. Brianna also informed Surik that she always trained to better herself, and they discussed the Echani view of expression of feelings through combat. As one final question, Brianna asked what it was like to feel [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and was satisfied by the answers both Surik and Kreia provided.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Travels with Meetra Surik===\\n{{Quote|I want to fight with you side by side, for as long as there are enemies that threaten you.

While Rand vocally objected to allowing a spy to travel with them, Surik welcomed Brianna to the crew. At this point, however, Brianna was still wary of Surik, as she had been warned by Atris not to trust her. She secluded herself inside the cargo bay so that she could hone her fighting style, while keeping herself separate from the rest of the crew.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_KotORCG.jpg|thumb|180px|Brianna, during her time with Meetra Surik]]\\nWhile Surik attempted to get to know Brianna, the Echani continued to be wary of trusting her, but through acts of kindness and charity during their journey, Brianna finally believed that Atris had been wrong in her judgments. Brianna occasionally clashed with [[Visas Marr]], a former Sith assassin who was initially on a mission to capture Surik. Although Marr joined the crew after her defeat at Surik\\'s hands, Brianna did not trust her due to Marr\\'s ties to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. After some convincing from Surik, Brianna learned to accept her presence, although she still kept a watchful eye on the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]].<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nDuring their travels, Brianna agreed to teach Surik [[Echani (martial art)/Legends|Echani fighting techniques]]. As they trained, Surik challenged Brianna\\'s Echani tradition about sparring while wearing only undergarments; Brianna conceded that bulkier clothes would be more practical. She surprised Surik by then changing into a heavy set of [[Handmaiden\\'s robe|grayed robes]], the style associated with a Jedi Master. When asked, she finally revealed that they were the last keepsake of her mother that she had never known. She opened up to Surik and revealed the story of her past, but she asked that it be kept secret from the rest of the crew, as she had come to trust Surik over everyone else. Unexpectedly, after their private discussion, Surik was approached by Kreia who revealed that she had known Arren Kae. Kreia speculated that because Kae had been strong in the Force, that the potential to become a Jedi also lay within her daughter. Kreia discouraged Surik from training her as a Jedi, however, because it would mean breaking her oath to Atris.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSurik decided to leave the choice to Brianna, and offered to train her to use the Force. By this point, Brianna greatly trusted Surik and realized that she had hoped to follow her mother\\'s path her entire life. Consequently, she accepted the offer. Surik warned her she would be breaking her oath to Atris, but Brianna was committed, feeling that she would be betraying her heritage if she didn\\'t accept the training. With Brianna\\'s acceptance, Surik passed on her knowledge of the Force to Brianna, and trained her to become a [[Jedi Guardian]]. During this time, Kreia [[Telepathy/Legends|sent a message]] to Atris through the Force telling her of Brianna\\'s choice to become a Jedi with a single word: \"Betrayal.\" As a Jedi, Brianna continued to aid Surik, who eventually succeeded in gathering the Jedi Masters [[Vrook Lamar]], [[Zez-Kai Ell]] and [[Kavar]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. Brianna returned to the Enclave on Dantooine with Surik, who set off to meet with the Masters alone. Unfortunately, when the Masters revealed their intentions to [[Sever Force/Legends|strip]] Surik of the Force due to the danger she posed by her particular ability to [[Wound in the Force|feed off the life energy of others]], Kreia was forced to act and killed the Jedi Masters. Before incapacitating the Exile, Kreia revealed she had been manipulating Surik all along, and that her ultimate goal had been to utilize Surik\\'s unique nature to cease the influence of the Force on all sapients.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Confronting the Sith====\\n{{Quote|You are no longer one of us. You followed the Jedi, betrayed your oath.|The Handmaiden Sisters to Brianna|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_Sisters.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Brianna\\'s sisters confront her on Telos.]]\\nFollowing the incident on Dantooine, Brianna, believing Surik to be dead, took Kreia directly to Atris, knowing that her mistress would execute any Sith. However, Atris\\'s belief in the Jedi Council\\'s decision during the Mandalorian Wars, as well as her belief in the Order itself, had been shaken after she observed Surik\\'s conviction. In addition, she had been slowly corrupted by her collection of [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]], which she had gathered in hopes of using their teachings to fight the Sith. Instead, the influence of the artifacts proved too strong, and they slowly twisted Atris\\'s thinking, causing her to fall to the dark side.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAtris finally admitted her fall to the dark side after a conversation with Kreia. Simultaneously, the other handmaidens [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|confronted]] Brianna. She learned that Atris had told her sisters that Brianna had fallen to the dark side and joined Surik against Atris\\'s wishes. Brianna could not convince her sisters otherwise, and was forced to fight them. In doing so, she proved herself to have surpassed her sisters in ability, as she managed to defeat them all without killing them. Shortly thereafter, Atris arrived and attacked Brianna. Though Brianna was initially able to keep the corrupt Jedi Master at bay, she was eventually overwhelmed. Atris began [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] her handmaiden with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]; but, before she could deliver the final blow, Surik arrived and defeated Atris in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]]. After the duel, Brianna pledged undying allegiance to Surik, renouncing her title of Last of the Handmaidens, and embracing her true name as well as her status as a disciple of the last Jedi.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBefore leaving Telos, Kreia manipulated the Sith into [[Battle of Telos IV|attacking Citadel Station]], forcing Surik to fight off an assault and help defend the station before she could follow her teacher. Brianna aided Surik and the Telos Security Force in fending off the Sith assault on Citadel Station before joining Surik in pursuit of Kreia. Surik had learned from Atris that Kreia had gone to a [[Trayus Academy|secret Sith academy]] on [[Malachor V]], the site of the [[Battle of Malachor V|final battle]] of the Mandalorian Wars, and the site where Surik had previously lost her connection to the Force after killing countless combatants on both sides by activating the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] during the battle. On this occasion, the Sith Lord intended to use Malachor V&mdash;a site where the Force still echoed from those killed by the Mass Shadow Generator&mdash;to create a [[wound in the Force]], which in turn would allow her to carry out her goal of destroying the Force itself. When the group arrived at Malachor V, however, the massive storms surrounding the planet damaged the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\', causing it to crash. In the crash, the members of the group were separated, and Brianna was unable to help Surik, who went on to [[Battle of Malachor|confront]] Kreia alone.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Legacy===\\nKreia, shortly before her death on Malachor V at the hands of Surik, looked into the future, and told her that Brianna would give up her ways of battle, play a vital role in rebuilding the Jedi Order. According to her, Brianna would follow her passion and take Atris\\'s role as [[Jedi historian|historian]], teaching future [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] about the Jedi who gave up the Force, and became better for it.<ref name=\"TSL\" />{{Endgame}}\\n\\nCenturies later, the [[New Jedi Order]] would also remember Brianna for her role in the Order\\'s history. Brianna was credited as one of the [[Lost Jedi]] and an instrumental companion who aided Surik. Due to the uncertain records of the era, the New Jedi Order tentatively named her as one of the potential slayers of Sith Lord [[Darth Nihilus]], alongside another possible candidate, Visas Marr.<ref name=\"EGttF\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']]</ref>\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\n{{Quote|Well, good thing it\\'s not a trap.\\'\\'\"<br />\"\\'\\'What are you talking about?

She bore the shame of her parents\\' forbidden affair, and as a result strove to prove her worth to her sisters and Atris. Her shame and position as the least worthy among her sisters led her to adopt a style of thinking in which she placed the greater good and her oaths to Atris before herself, forsaking her name and identity. It was not until she finally defeated her sisters in combat and confronted Atris that Brianna fully gained a sense of self-worth, finally embracing her name as a result, and casting aside the shame of her parentage. She believed combat to be one of the purest ways of expressing oneself, and that a person\\'s fighting style accurately displayed what kind of person they were.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBrianna was steadfastly loyal to her superiors, and was completely devoted to Atris before Meetra Surik earned her trust. She was initially very slow to trust Surik due to the warnings Atris had given, but Surik\\'s kindness, as well as Brianna\\'s reading of her through combat caused her to eventually open up. When Surik saved her life, Brianna completely renounced her ties to Atris. Her trust did not extend to Surik\\'s other companions, however, and she remained wary of both Kreia and Marr for the extent of their journey.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nIn addition, despite being criticized by her sisters for her passion, Brianna was typically very reserved and did not interact much with the crew, choosing to seclude herself in the cargo bay instead. Despite this, her irritation with her fellow crew members occasionally showed, typically with Rand and Marr. She expressed her passion through combat, and developed a yearning to feel the Force, eventually receiving Jedi training from the Exile. This curiosity stemmed from her having examined some of Atris\\'s [[Holocron/Legends|Jedi holocrons]], and her interest in these artifacts may have led to her taking the position of Jedi historian as Kreia predicted.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nHaving lived a relatively sheltered life in the secret academy on Telos, Brianna displayed some naïveté towards the workings of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], a fact commented on by Atton Rand. She also failed to grasp jokes made by Surik and the bounty hunter [[Mira]], as well as Rand\\'s sarcasm. Brianna tended to view things in terms of black and white, and argued with Surik over some of her decisions, feeling that any act of questionable morality was unacceptable, a mindset she likely developed from following Atris\\' own strict beliefs.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{Quote|She has always brought shame upon us.

Brianna found her training to be helpful in maintaining her focus, and trained often while traveling with Surik, particularly when annoyed by Surik\\'s other companions. In addition, Brianna was skilled in the use of [[Precognition/Legends|Battle Precognition]], which allowed her to perceive her opponents\\' intentions an instant before they acted, giving her an edge in combat. She recognized Surik\\'s potential with precognition and taught her to use the ability as well. Her combat prowess extended to numerous weapons including [[Force pike/Legends|Force pikes]] and blasters. Brianna also utilized a unique [[Handmaiden\\'s staff|staff]] that possessed qualities similar to a [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|saberstaff]], and was given to her by her father. Along with her various weapons, Brianna could also fight effectively unarmed due to her proficiency in Echani.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAs the daughter of a Jedi, Arren Kae, Brianna was Force-sensitive and eventually accepted Jedi training from Surik, becoming a Jedi Guardian. As a Jedi Guardian, Brianna focused on combat and learned the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] techniques and abilities of the Jedi, supplementing her skills with powers such as [[Force Jump]]. With Jedi training, her combat proficiency increased to the point where she surpassed even her sisters in skill and managed to defeat all of them together in combat. Brianna was even able to duel evenly against Jedi Master Atris for a while before being overwhelmed by Force Lightning. She also displayed significant endurance, and was able to stand after being battered by Force Lightning and seemed relatively steady despite the ordeal.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Equipment==\\nBrianna possessed many items she was given by her parents, including Jedi robes from her mother and staff from her father. The Jedi robe inherited from her mother, Arren Kae, was light-grey in color. It also provided her some improvements and protection.

This inconsistency can most likely be attributed to the [[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']] being written from an [[in-universe]] point of view, with the [[New Jedi Order]]\\'s records on the battle being inaccurate.

Upon opening the character selection screen, her space will have no picture, and the name will be replaced by the words \"I am so very very broken.\" Should the player attempt to speak to Brianna when Surik has more influence with Visas than Brianna, she will get upset and refuse to speak to him for the remainder of the game.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Dark side ending===\\n[[File:Briannadsportrait.jpg|thumb|right|Brianna with [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] alignment]]\\nDue to Meetra Surik\\'s unique ability to form close bonds with her companions and even twist their motivations to her will, Brianna can be influenced to fall to the dark side. If Brianna joins Surik and then falls to the dark side, Kreia predicts that she will stop looking up to the Jedi and give herself over to battle completely. She abandons her Force training and instead will punish the Jedi for being too emotional. Should Brianna fall to the dark side and become a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] Guardian, she also replaces her pure white clothing with a similar looking garment that is completely black and fastened with leather.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Playing as a male Surik====\\n{{Quote|I wish to see what the Handmaiden sees when she looks at you that causes her heart to race, and her tone to change.|Visas Marr|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nAlthough it was confirmed to be [[canon]] that Brianna accompanied Surik during her travels,<ref name=\"KOTOR minis preview 5\" /><ref name=\"Tasty Taste answer\" /> in the game itself, she would only accompany Surik if the player was male. Otherwise, she would be replaced by [[Mical]]. At some point Surik asked Brianna to teach her Echani fighting techniques, and over the course of their journey they sparred three times, each time learning more about each other and became closer, to the point that both Atton and Kreia would notice and comment on it.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nThe main difference in Brianna\\'s journey with a male Surik would be her development of romantic feelings towards Surik, as well as her rivalry with Visas for his affections. When Visas is first accepted into the group by Surik, Brianna challenges his choice, feeling that Visas could betray them to the Sith, and also displayed jealousy at Surik\\'s willingness to accept another woman so easily. If Surik had higher influence with Visas than Brianna, she would confront the Miraluka in jealousy, accusing her of planning to betray them to the Sith, and ignoring the latter\\'s attempts to placate her. Brianna\\'s envy would grow to the point where Kreia would take advantage of it, manipulating the handmaiden\\'s feelings and convincing her to be ready to confront Visas when Kreia felt the time was right.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nWith a male Surik, Brianna would also take Kreia to Atris, with her grief over Surik\\'s death clouding her judgment. She would confront her sisters, as well as Atris, who would eventually use Force lightning. Brianna was unprepared and thrown to her knees after one hit, but Atris tortured her with another round of lightning, her jealousy burning over Brianna\\'s closeness to Surik and accusing her of falling in love with him as Brianna laid writhing in agony. Rendered hurt and helpless, it seemed Atris was going to finish her off, when suddenly Surik appeared at the last second, and challenged Atris to a duel. Only further angered by Surik\\'s display of concern, she struck Brianna one last time with lightning and, leaving her for dead on the floor, retreated to her chamber to do battle with Surik.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAfter Surik dueled with Atris, Brianna surprisingly managed to survive the vicious assault, and now without the oath to her sisters or her mistress to hold her there, she once again pledged herself to Surik in gratitude. This time she would never let the stigma of her family hold her back from following her heart again.

She was deeply committed to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Order]] and was a fierce adherent of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]]. But Atris\\' faith in the righteousness of the Jedi wavered when her personal hero, [[Meetra Surik]], turned her back on the Council to join rogue Knights [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]] and their [[Revanchist|faction]] of Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. Atris chose not to go to war, but this decision left her bitter and conflicted.\\n\\nWhen Surik returned to face the Council\\'s judgment after the devastating events of the [[Battle of Malachor V]], Atris was the first to condemn her, suggesting that she had fallen to the dark side just as Revan had. Over time, Atris grew to hate Surik for complicating her black-and-white view of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. During the [[Dark Wars]], Atris called a secret Jedi [[Conclave at Katarr|convocation]] on the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] world of [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]] in an attempt to find the threat that was stalking the Jedi. She then leaked knowledge of the conclave\\'s existence in the hopes of drawing out the Sith. She succeeded, but with dire consequences; [[Darth Nihilus]] devastated the surface of the planet, wiping out all life on Katarr, including the Jedi gathered there.\\n\\nHowever, Atris survived, and she remained in seclusion, surrounding herself with [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] [[Handmaiden Sisters|Handmaidens]] who could not feel the Force. She planned to rebuild the Jedi Order, and established a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]] in the old irrigation system on [[Telos IV]]. However, she was heavily influenced by the many [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]] she had collected in her efforts to find and understand the Sith. The holocrons fed her bitterness, and she slowly and quietly fell to the dark side, consequently becoming the new \\'\\'\\'Darth Traya\\'\\'\\', the \\'\\'\\'Queen of Betrayal\\'\\'\\'. Per the machinations of her mentor, [[Kreia]], Surik and the new [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Traya confronted each other once more on Telos, where Surik convinced Atris to turn away from the dark side.

She argued that there was little wonder why Kun and Qel-Droma fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], when the Jedi had liberal instruction practices in place, such as dozens of [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] training under a single Master, the radical bonds of reciprocal apprenticeship, and Jedi beginning their training in their teens and later. She invoked thousand-year old recommendations first suggested by the Jedi Master [[Simikarty]], lobbying for the restriction of Padawans that a Master could have at one time, and also limiting the age of Jedi candidates.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\\n\\nAtris also advocated prohibiting romantic involvement for Jedi, citing that the [[First Great Schism]] had been started by two lovers. She even endorsed adoption of a more austere interpretation of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] which was favored by the [[Draethos (species)|Draethos]] Jedi Master [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]], in memory of his death at the hands of Exar Kun at the Jedi Academy on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. Her arguments found powerful purchase amongst the Jedi, and she was appointed to High Council.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\\n\\n===The Mandalorian Wars===\\n{{Quote|We all have our heroes.

Many followed them, including the Jedi [[Meetra Surik]]. Atris had held a strong admiration for Surik, viewing her as something of a hero as well as a close friend. When she and Revan left the Order to join the war, rejecting everything that Atris believed in, Atris felt personally betrayed.<ref name=\"FMWA\" /> Atris condemned Revan, his followers, and the \"freethinking\" teachings of his former Jedi Master, fellow historian [[Kreia]]. Revan\\'s eventual turn to the dark side came as little surprise to Atris.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> Indeed, when Revan met Atris years later asking what happened to Surik, Atris made little effort to conceal her contempt.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\">\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nAfter the war\\'s end, only one of the Jedi who had followed Revan to war [[Trial of Meetra Surik|returned to face the council]]: Meetra Surik.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> She stood before them as an echo in the Force, having cut herself off from it after the final battle at [[Malachor V]]. Surik was so defiant, so certain of the rightness of her actions that she caused Atris to doubt herself. Atris wanted to punish Surik for this, and became convinced that she had fallen to the dark side along with all of the others who had followed Revan. She felt that exile was too lenient of a punishment for Surik\\'s betrayal, and believed that she would only join Revan again if she was free. The other Masters warned her to be mindful of her feelings, but Atris insisted that Surik ought to have died at Malachor V, because when she stood before them, it was if she was already dead. The Council decided not to tell Surik that she had become a [[wound in the Force]], which was the result of her actions at Malachor.<ref name=\"FMWA\" />\\n\\nAtris kept [[Meetra Surik\\'s first lightsaber|Surik\\'s lightsaber]] after the trial, carrying it with her always.

He accessed the file on Surik and found it lacking in information about her whereabouts. Behind him, Atris spoke out, during their conversation she revealed that Surik had disconnected herself from the Force because of the guilt she carried over her actions during the Mandalorian Wars. Although Revan felt responsible for Surik\\'s fate, he refused to give her the satisfaction of seeing his guilt and grief. She stormed out of the room.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\" />\\n\\n===The Dark Wars===\\n{{Quote|It is such a quiet thing, to fall.

To make matters worse, some \\'\\'thing\\'\\' was systematically hunting and killing what Jedi there were left. Atris rallied a secret [[Conclave at Katarr|Jedi convocation]] on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]], a colony world of the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]], where the threat could be assessed and the future of the Order discussed.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> However, Atris leaked knowledge of the session in hopes of drawing out this threat so that it could be fought. Unfortunately, she greatly underestimated its strength. The Sith arrived in the form of [[Darth Nihilus]], who proved to be too powerful for the Jedi. Through the Force, he devoured all life on the planet, including the Jedi and Miraluka (with the single exception of [[Visas Marr]], whom he later took as his apprentice). Atris, having not attended the Conclave, survived, along with a handful of other Masters who went into hiding.<ref name=\"CotOR\">\\'\\'[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nAtris took refuge under a polar ice cap on the planet [[Telos IV]], where she began to build a secret [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi academy]] in an old irrigation system.

To that end, she trained [[Handmaiden Sisters|a group of half-sisters]], specially equipped and trained to resist [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] and, if necessary, use their [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] combat skills to subdue wayward Jedi. Atris planned to eventually rebuild the Jedi Order, but she greatly overestimated her own ability to resist the dark side, becoming corrupted by delving into the forbidden knowledge of her collection of Sith holocrons.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Reunion with Meetra Surik====\\n{{Quote|I did not expect to see you again after the day of your sentencing. I thought you had taken the exile\\'s path, wandering the galaxy. Yet you have returned - why?|Atris, to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nIn [[3951 BBY]], Meetra Surik and her companions landed on Telos IV, having narrowly escaped the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction]] of the [[Peragus Mining Facility]] at [[Peragus II]]. Upon hearing that the [[Telos Security Force]] held an individual called the Jedi Exile and her party under house arrest for their suspected involvement in the explosion of the mining facility, Atris desired to uncover the cause of the explosion, knowing that the consequences of its loss would be tremendous. Therefore, she sent one of her Handmaidens by the name of [[Brianna]], to steal their ship, the \\'\\'[[Ebon Hawk]]\\'\\', as well as [[T3-M4]] who, fortunately for her, was on board. The ship and droid were dissected for information, though little of value was actually found.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n[[File:Atristrial.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A holorecord of Atris at the Jedi Exile\\'s trial.]]\\nUpon discovering the loss of her ship, Surik managed to [[Skirmish on Telos|trace]] the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' to the polar plateau where Atris\\'s academy was hidden. Once she found her way inside, Atris had Surik\\'s companions placed in [[force cage]]s while the Handmaidens brought Meetra Surik before her to be questioned. Not long before this, Atris had discovered Surik\\'s identity, and was surprised at the revelation&mdash;she had not expected to see her again after the Council sentenced her to Exile.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAt first she hoped that Surik had returned to admit that the Council had been right and to face up to her crimes, but that was not the case. Surik\\'s presence stirred unpleasant feelings which Atris had all but forgotten, and hoped lost. These feelings showed themselves when she accused Meetra Surik of walking the dark path, when Atris\\' words were the ones that sounded bitter and resentful. In fact, she was so angry about what Surik did that she refused to believe that Surik had meant to help others in the Mandalorian Wars, and said she simply went off for the adventure and the excitement of battle. Atris continued to berate Surik by blaming her for the destruction of Peragus II. She was shocked to learn the Sith were behind it, and even more shocked when she learned the Sith were hunting Meetra Surik. She reluctantly accepted Surik\\'s offer of help in defeating them, and instructed her to gather other Jedi on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] so that action could be taken and a Council could be had.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAfter departing Telos IV, Surik discovered that T3-M4 had downloaded Atris\\'s archives. It seemed that Atris had kept a holo record of her trial, as well as a list of the remaining [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]&mdash;despite her claim that she was the \"last of the Jedi\" because T3 had been able to slice into the historian\\'s files and copy them, locating the Jedi Masters for Atris\\'s proposed meeting proved easier.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Admission and letting go====\\nAs Atris sought desperately to understand Surik\\'s motives, which was part of the reason for her keeping of the [[Holocron/Legends|holocrons]], she clung even more desperately to her perfect view of the Jedi. However, in light of Surik\\'s choices, she knew that either she or the Council was wrong. Though she placed Surik in the wrong, it only made her more unsettled, as, inwardly, she respected her choice. It built up a pressure that finally exploded when Kreia, who had then revealed her former identity as Darth Traya after she had killed the three Council members [[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Kavar]], and [[Vrook Lamar]] when they reconvened on Dantooine, stripped Atris of her self-denials and allowed her to finally accepting that she was betrayed by her dark persona; Atris embraced herself as Darth Traya,<ref name=\"Admission\">\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', When Kreia speaks to Atris while in her meditation chamber.</ref> the Queen of Betrayal,<ref name=\"TSLOSG\">\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]\\'\\'</ref> and was told by Kreia that Meetra Surik would return to her sanctum on Telos to confront her for the last time.<ref name=\"Admission\" />\\n\\nAfter being informed by an Onderonian colonel named [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] of the Jedi academy on Telos, who had been in turn informed by Kreia, Darth Nihilus attacked Telos, believing that he could feed on what Jedi were there.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nWhen Surik, who was searching for Kreia after having been left by the former Sith, returned to the Academy, Darth Traya [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|clashed]] with her in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]], and was defeated. Surik, however, spared her life. This action was something Traya believed Meetra Surik would never have done. However, it led her to forgo the moniker of Darth Traya and for Atris to chose to let go of the Jedi; to be exiled from the Order to find her human self once more.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Atris was held captive in her sanctum until judged by [[Mical]] and the new Jedi Council; the disciples of Meetra Surik.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\n[[File:Atris_KotORCG.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Atris, Jedi Master and Historian.]]\\nAtris was extremely dedicated to the Jedi Order, and believed in their righteousness to the point of arrogance and fanaticism. She was impatient with dissenters, and took accusations against the Jedi very personally. When many Jedi left the order to follow Revan to war, Atris was eager to write them all off as traitors and Sith, even Meetra Surik after she returned to face the Council.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nDuring the Dark Wars, Atris became reclusive, and obsessed with preserving what she could of the Jedi legacy, including the Sith relics which would ultimately lead her down the path to the dark side. She was bitter and untrusting, surrounding herself with Echani warriors trained to resist the Force. Though she claimed to be building a Jedi Academy, she made no efforts to bring Force-sensitives to train. In fact, despite knowing the locations of the Jedi Masters Zez-Kai Ell, Vrook Lamar, Kavar, and [[Lonna Vash]], she made no attempt to contact them, and none of them knew that she was still alive.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nIt was ironic that despite the fact that Atris championed various causes, such as the limitation of the amount of Padawans a single Master could have,<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> or the fact that she attempted to preserve Jedi knowledge,<ref name=\"TSL\" /> she herself never took a Padawan.<ref>\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', When Meetra Surik talks to one of the Handmaidens that is not Brianna, that handmaiden mentions this fact.</ref>\\n\\nAtris wore an all-white variation of the traditional robes of a Jedi historian.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{Quote|All this collected knowledge, all these teachings of combat and the Force - they are mine to command.|Atris to the Jedi Exile|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nAtris was a very powerful Jedi Master, using powers such as [[Force suppression]], [[Ionize|Droid Disable]], and [[Force Stun|Force stun]].

One possible ending featured Kreia\\'s redemption and Atris\\'s total shift to the dark side, which culminated in the scene where Atris attacked the player wearing a black robe and claimed that she, not Kreia, was Darth Traya. Her dark side model remained in the PC version of the game and can appear in the main menu if the CurSithLord option is set to 1 in swkotor2.ini. An [[Wikipedia:Datel Action Replay|Action Replay]] mod is needed to view it on the Xbox. You may also use the model in the KOTOR/TSL Save Game Editor. If the KOTOR Save Editor is used, the code for her dark side model is Unique_Darth_Traya, indicating she was meant to become the new Darth Traya.\\n\\nLater on, the dark side model of Atris (see above) was planned to be put in the final game for the confrontation with Atris, but it was removed a few weeks before the game was released, with the reason that the presence of the dark side model was confusing the game testers.\\n\\n==Appearances==\\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Atris}}\\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 9|\\'\\'Knights of the Old Republic\\'\\' 9]]\\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|\\'\\'Knights of the Old Republic\\'\\' 29]]\\n*\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'\\n*[[The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)|\\'\\'The Old Republic: Revan\\'\\' audiobook]]\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\' {{1st}}\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]\\'\\' {{Mo}}\\n*[[Cartel Market|\\'\\'Star Wars: The Old Republic\\'\\' Cartel Market]] {{C|Outfit}}\\n\\n==Sources==\\n*\\'\\'[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]\\'\\' {{1stm}}\\n*\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[The New Essential Chronology]]\\'\\' {{ID|Darth Traya}}\\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']]\\n*\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]\\'\\' {{Po}}\\n\\n==Notes and references==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n{{CouncilMandWar}}\\n\\n{{CouncilAMandWar}}\\n\\n{{Start box}}\\n{{Succession box\\n|title=[[Chief Librarian/Legends|Chief Librarian]] of the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]]\\n|years=[[3954 BBY]]&ndash;[[3951 BBY]]\\n|before=Unknown\\n|after=Eventually [[Ostar-Gal]]\\n}}\\n{{End box}}\\n\\n{{Interlang\\n|da=Atris\\n|de=Atris#legends\\n|es=Atris\\n|fr=Atris\\n|hu=Atris\\n|pl=Atris\\n|pt=Atris\\n|ru=Эйтрис\\n|deFA=1\\n}}\\n\\n[[Category:Darths]]\\n[[Category:Females]]\\n[[Category:Humans]]\\n[[Category:Jedi High Council members]]\\n[[Category:Lore Keepers]]\\n[[Category:Lost Jedi (Jedi Order)]]\\n[[Category:Redeemed Jedi]]')]"

The illegitimate daughter to the famous Echani [[General/Legends|General]] [[Yusanis]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arren Kae]], both of whom fought in the [[Mandalorian Wars]], she later served along with her five half-sisters as the [[Handmaiden Sisters]] under Jedi Master [[Atris]] in the period following the [[Jedi Civil War]]. During her service to Atris at the [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]] on [[Telos IV]], Brianna met [[Meetra Surik]], also known as the Jedi Exile, and was subsequently tasked with accompanying her on her mission to seek out the [[Lost Jedi]], Jedi Masters who survived the [[First Jedi Purge]]. As Surik\\'s companion, Brianna helped battle against numerous adversaries, including the [[Sith Triumvirate]].\\n\\nDuring the journey, Brianna trained Surik in [[Echani (martial art)/Legends|Echani]] techniques and eventually received [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]] from Surik in return, becoming one of the [[Lost Jedi|first new members]] of the Jedi Order after the Purge. In accepting such training, however, she broke her oath to Atris. The Jedi Master labeled her a traitor, resulting in a confrontation between Brianna, her sisters and her former master. According to the predictions of [[Kreia]], Brianna would become instrumental in the reconstruction of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and succeed Atris as its lead [[Jedi historian]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n===Early life===\\n{{Quote|I knew her mother.

She joined the Mandalorian Wars after the shame of her birth was revealed.|Kreia|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Briannafull.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brianna, the last handmaiden]]\\nBrianna was born in [[3976 BBY]]<ref name=\"age\" /> as the result of a forbidden union between [[General/Legends|General]] [[Yusanis]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arren Kae]]. Yusanis, a master [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] combatant of the Republic world [[Eshan/Legends|Eshan]], was married to another woman to whom he had five daughters, while Kae, as a member of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] was forbidden to form strong attachments. Despite these restrictions, the couple began a secret relationship, risking their status by continuing to meet. Despite Kae\\'s attempts to keep the affair and Brianna\\'s existence a secret, the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] eventually found out about the situation, and Kae was [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled from the Jedi Order]] as punishment.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nKae later chose to join her former apprentice, [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], to fight the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]], who were bent on [[Mandalorian Wars|conquering the Outer Rim]]. Yusanis joined them, despite the fact that he was responsible for the care of Brianna and his other five daughters. Yusanis and Kae became known as heroes of the conflict, but Kae eventually fell in battle, and Yusanis returned a broken man, abandoning battle to become a [[Senator/Legends|senator]]. He avoided speaking of Kae, leaving Brianna with no memories of her mother. Later, Yusanis\\'s old ally Revan declared himself the new [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and turned on the Jedi, starting the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He sought to weaken the Republic, and targeted the Republic worlds of [[Serroco]], [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] and [[Eshan/Legends|Eshan]] for destabilization. Revan accomplished his goals by assassinating a senator from each world, and the death of an Echani senator caught Yusanis\\' attention. When Yusanis found evidence of the act, he challenged Revan to a duel, but was ultimately slain by the Dark Lord, leaving Brianna an orphan.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSometime after Yusanis\\'s death, Brianna and her five half-sisters entered the service of Jedi Master [[Atris]], one of the few Masters who survived the Jedi Civil War. The Jedi Order had been greatly divided and weakened by the war, and further attacks by a resurgent [[Sith Triumvirate|Sith Order]] after the war\\'s conclusion left very few Jedi remaining. Atris hoped to revive the Jedi Order after most of the other Jedi Masters had been [[Conclave at Katarr|killed]] during one of these attacks on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]], and established a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|secret academy]] on [[Telos IV]], a planet that had been [[Bombing of Telos IV|devastated]] by Sith forces during the Jedi Civil War. The sisters joined her in the academy and agreed to serve as her [[handmaiden]]s, aiding Atris in gathering [[Holocron/Legends|Jedi artifacts]] from around the galaxy. At one point during their service, Brianna and her half-sisters swore an oath to Atris that they would never study the teachings of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], nor receive any [[Jedi training/Legends|instruction]] from a Jedi; although Brianna was the only handmaiden who had any [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitivity]] due to her heritage. While Atris knew of Brianna\\'s familial lineage, as well as her sensitivity, she never mentioned Brianna\\'s potential, and the handmaiden remained ignorant of her innate abilities.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nThe offspring of Echani parents appeared to non-Echani to look identical to their parents, typically the one of the same [[Gender/Legends|sex]]. As such, Brianna resembled her Jedi mother and not Yusanis\\' original wife, which distinguished her from her sisters as physical evidence of their father\\'s affair. Her father\\'s infidelity had brought shame on himself; and, after his death at the hands of Revan, that shame was thrust upon her, as the Echani believed that betrayal and shame were passed down through bloodlines. Despite working hard to disprove this stigma that followed her all through her young life, Brianna was branded the \"Last of the Handmaidens\" by her sisters, meaning she was the least of them, in terms of worth and combat ability. As a result, Brianna felt she was unworthy of bearing any signs of individuality and renounced her name in favor of her title.<ref name=\"TSL\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\">\\'\\'[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\n===Meetra Surik\\'s arrival===\\n{{Quote|I will not warn you again. Drop your weapons, or we shall take them from you.|Brianna to Meetra Surik upon the latter\\'s arrival at the Academy.|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_Hawk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Security feed showing Brianna boarding the Ebon Hawk]]\\nThe Jedi Academy was secluded in the isolated polar regions of Telos IV, and consequently, the academy remained unnoticed, even when the Republic began the [[Telosian Restoration Project]] in an effort to restore the ecosystem of the devastated planet. The project was headed by the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Chodo Habat]] and his [[Chodo Habat\\'s herd|herd]], and a massive [[Citadel Station|space station]] was built in orbit as a staging area for the project. When Atris later learned that the planet [[Peragus II]], the main source of the station\\'s fuel had been destroyed and that the [[Telos Security Force]] was holding [[Meetra Surik|suspects]] in the planet\\'s destruction, who had recently arrived in the system, she ordered Brianna to investigate. Acting covertly, Brianna sneaked onto Citadel Station and stole the suspects\\' ship, the \\'\\'[[Ebon Hawk]]\\'\\', as well as their droid, [[T3-M4]], which was aboard as a result of the ship being impounded after arriving at Citadel Station shortly after the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction of]] Peragus II. Brianna then brought the ship to the secret academy where Atris hoped to look into the events surrounding the destruction of the planet. Atris was unaware that the new owner of the ship was a former friend from the Jedi Order,<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Meetra Surik,<ref name=\"revan\">\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'</ref> also known as the Jedi Exile, another hero of the Mandalorian Wars who was exiled for her defiance of the Jedi Council and her decision to join Revan in the war. Surik was released from custody when it was discovered that Peragus II had been destroyed as a result of her escape from the Sith Lord [[Darth Sion]], and she began a search for her stolen ship.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSurik, along with companions [[Kreia]] and [[Atton Rand]], whom she had met on Peragus II, eventually located the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] with some help from a [[Bao-Dur|technician]] of the Restoration Project and entered the academy. Brianna, flanked by two of her sisters, confronted the group and demanded their surrender. Surik agreed so as to avoid a conflict, and Brianna escorted her to meet with Atris. Atris had been one of the masters who decided on Surik\\'s punishment for her involvement in the Mandalorian Wars, and was not pleased to see her again. After a charged discussion over Surik\\'s seeming unrepentant attitude towards her actions in defying the Council, she informed Atris of the Sith\\'s involvement in the destruction of Peragus II, and offered her aid. Atris suggested she seek out the other surviving Jedi Masters and gather them at the ruined Enclave on Dantooine in order to form a plan of action, and sent Surik away. Brianna was startled to have seen her mistress become so volatile, strengthening her growing belief that the Jedi were not the passionless beings Atris had described them to be.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBefore Surik departed Telos, Brianna was able to speak to her in private. Brianna was wary of Surik at first, but began to speak more freely when Surik managed to convince her that, contrary to Atris\\'s opinion, she had not turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] during the Mandalorian Wars. Brianna confessed that she was the only one of her sisters who did not doubt Surik\\'s battle prowess and was more receptive to Surik\\'s opinion. Brianna also mentioned how she was often distracted by the [[Jedi artifact/Legends|Jedi teachings]] Atris had rescued and stored at the academy; and, as a result, was eager to learn about life as a Jedi. She asked about various details of a Jedi\\'s life, including the issue of attachment. Brianna also informed Surik that she always trained to better herself, and they discussed the Echani view of expression of feelings through combat. As one final question, Brianna asked what it was like to feel [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and was satisfied by the answers both Surik and Kreia provided.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Travels with Meetra Surik===\\n{{Quote|I want to fight with you side by side, for as long as there are enemies that threaten you.

Additionally, Brianna was to monitor Surik\\'s activities for Atris in order to confirm that Surik still served the light side.<ref name=\"KOTOR minis preview 5\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/KOTORminispreview5|text=\\'\\'Knights of the Old Republic\\'\\' Miniatures Preview 5|int=Knights of the Old Republic Miniatures Preview 5|archivedate=20090602104626}}</ref> Brianna revealed herself upon learning Surik had downloaded some of Atris\\' records, indignantly protesting what she viewed as theft before composing herself and explaining her orders. While Rand vocally objected to allowing a spy to travel with them, Surik welcomed Brianna to the crew. At this point, however, Brianna was still wary of Surik, as she had been warned by Atris not to trust her. She secluded herself inside the cargo bay so that she could hone her fighting style, while keeping herself separate from the rest of the crew.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_KotORCG.jpg|thumb|180px|Brianna, during her time with Meetra Surik]]\\nWhile Surik attempted to get to know Brianna, the Echani continued to be wary of trusting her, but through acts of kindness and charity during their journey, Brianna finally believed that Atris had been wrong in her judgments. Brianna occasionally clashed with [[Visas Marr]], a former Sith assassin who was initially on a mission to capture Surik. Although Marr joined the crew after her defeat at Surik\\'s hands, Brianna did not trust her due to Marr\\'s ties to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. After some convincing from Surik, Brianna learned to accept her presence, although she still kept a watchful eye on the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]].<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nDuring their travels, Brianna agreed to teach Surik [[Echani (martial art)/Legends|Echani fighting techniques]]. As they trained, Surik challenged Brianna\\'s Echani tradition about sparring while wearing only undergarments; Brianna conceded that bulkier clothes would be more practical. She surprised Surik by then changing into a heavy set of [[Handmaiden\\'s robe|grayed robes]], the style associated with a Jedi Master. When asked, she finally revealed that they were the last keepsake of her mother that she had never known. She opened up to Surik and revealed the story of her past, but she asked that it be kept secret from the rest of the crew, as she had come to trust Surik over everyone else. Unexpectedly, after their private discussion, Surik was approached by Kreia who revealed that she had known Arren Kae. Kreia speculated that because Kae had been strong in the Force, that the potential to become a Jedi also lay within her daughter. Kreia discouraged Surik from training her as a Jedi, however, because it would mean breaking her oath to Atris.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSurik decided to leave the choice to Brianna, and offered to train her to use the Force. By this point, Brianna greatly trusted Surik and realized that she had hoped to follow her mother\\'s path her entire life. Consequently, she accepted the offer. Surik warned her she would be breaking her oath to Atris, but Brianna was committed, feeling that she would be betraying her heritage if she didn\\'t accept the training. With Brianna\\'s acceptance, Surik passed on her knowledge of the Force to Brianna, and trained her to become a [[Jedi Guardian]]. During this time, Kreia [[Telepathy/Legends|sent a message]] to Atris through the Force telling her of Brianna\\'s choice to become a Jedi with a single word: \"Betrayal.\" As a Jedi, Brianna continued to aid Surik, who eventually succeeded in gathering the Jedi Masters [[Vrook Lamar]], [[Zez-Kai Ell]] and [[Kavar]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. Brianna returned to the Enclave on Dantooine with Surik, who set off to meet with the Masters alone. Unfortunately, when the Masters revealed their intentions to [[Sever Force/Legends|strip]] Surik of the Force due to the danger she posed by her particular ability to [[Wound in the Force|feed off the life energy of others]], Kreia was forced to act and killed the Jedi Masters. Before incapacitating the Exile, Kreia revealed she had been manipulating Surik all along, and that her ultimate goal had been to utilize Surik\\'s unique nature to cease the influence of the Force on all sapients.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Confronting the Sith====\\n{{Quote|You are no longer one of us. You followed the Jedi, betrayed your oath.|The Handmaiden Sisters to Brianna|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_Sisters.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Brianna\\'s sisters confront her on Telos.]]\\nFollowing the incident on Dantooine, Brianna, believing Surik to be dead, took Kreia directly to Atris, knowing that her mistress would execute any Sith. However, Atris\\'s belief in the Jedi Council\\'s decision during the Mandalorian Wars, as well as her belief in the Order itself, had been shaken after she observed Surik\\'s conviction. In addition, she had been slowly corrupted by her collection of [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]], which she had gathered in hopes of using their teachings to fight the Sith. Instead, the influence of the artifacts proved too strong, and they slowly twisted Atris\\'s thinking, causing her to fall to the dark side.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAtris finally admitted her fall to the dark side after a conversation with Kreia. Simultaneously, the other handmaidens [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|confronted]] Brianna. She learned that Atris had told her sisters that Brianna had fallen to the dark side and joined Surik against Atris\\'s wishes. Brianna could not convince her sisters otherwise, and was forced to fight them. In doing so, she proved herself to have surpassed her sisters in ability, as she managed to defeat them all without killing them. Shortly thereafter, Atris arrived and attacked Brianna. Though Brianna was initially able to keep the corrupt Jedi Master at bay, she was eventually overwhelmed. Atris began [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] her handmaiden with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]; but, before she could deliver the final blow, Surik arrived and defeated Atris in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]]. After the duel, Brianna pledged undying allegiance to Surik, renouncing her title of Last of the Handmaidens, and embracing her true name as well as her status as a disciple of the last Jedi.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBefore leaving Telos, Kreia manipulated the Sith into [[Battle of Telos IV|attacking Citadel Station]], forcing Surik to fight off an assault and help defend the station before she could follow her teacher. Brianna aided Surik and the Telos Security Force in fending off the Sith assault on Citadel Station before joining Surik in pursuit of Kreia. Surik had learned from Atris that Kreia had gone to a [[Trayus Academy|secret Sith academy]] on [[Malachor V]], the site of the [[Battle of Malachor V|final battle]] of the Mandalorian Wars, and the site where Surik had previously lost her connection to the Force after killing countless combatants on both sides by activating the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] during the battle. On this occasion, the Sith Lord intended to use Malachor V&mdash;a site where the Force still echoed from those killed by the Mass Shadow Generator&mdash;to create a [[wound in the Force]], which in turn would allow her to carry out her goal of destroying the Force itself. When the group arrived at Malachor V, however, the massive storms surrounding the planet damaged the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\', causing it to crash. In the crash, the members of the group were separated, and Brianna was unable to help Surik, who went on to [[Battle of Malachor|confront]] Kreia alone.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Legacy===\\nKreia, shortly before her death on Malachor V at the hands of Surik, looked into the future, and told her that Brianna would give up her ways of battle, play a vital role in rebuilding the Jedi Order. According to her, Brianna would follow her passion and take Atris\\'s role as [[Jedi historian|historian]], teaching future [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] about the Jedi who gave up the Force, and became better for it.<ref name=\"TSL\" />{{Endgame}}\\n\\nCenturies later, the [[New Jedi Order]] would also remember Brianna for her role in the Order\\'s history. Brianna was credited as one of the [[Lost Jedi]] and an instrumental companion who aided Surik. Due to the uncertain records of the era, the New Jedi Order tentatively named her as one of the potential slayers of Sith Lord [[Darth Nihilus]], alongside another possible candidate, Visas Marr.<ref name=\"EGttF\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']]</ref>\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\n{{Quote|Well, good thing it\\'s not a trap.\\'\\'\"<br />\"\\'\\'What are you talking about?

She bore the shame of her parents\\' forbidden affair, and as a result strove to prove her worth to her sisters and Atris. Her shame and position as the least worthy among her sisters led her to adopt a style of thinking in which she placed the greater good and her oaths to Atris before herself, forsaking her name and identity. It was not until she finally defeated her sisters in combat and confronted Atris that Brianna fully gained a sense of self-worth, finally embracing her name as a result, and casting aside the shame of her parentage. She believed combat to be one of the purest ways of expressing oneself, and that a person\\'s fighting style accurately displayed what kind of person they were.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBrianna was steadfastly loyal to her superiors, and was completely devoted to Atris before Meetra Surik earned her trust. She was initially very slow to trust Surik due to the warnings Atris had given, but Surik\\'s kindness, as well as Brianna\\'s reading of her through combat caused her to eventually open up. When Surik saved her life, Brianna completely renounced her ties to Atris. Her trust did not extend to Surik\\'s other companions, however, and she remained wary of both Kreia and Marr for the extent of their journey.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nIn addition, despite being criticized by her sisters for her passion, Brianna was typically very reserved and did not interact much with the crew, choosing to seclude herself in the cargo bay instead. Despite this, her irritation with her fellow crew members occasionally showed, typically with Rand and Marr. She expressed her passion through combat, and developed a yearning to feel the Force, eventually receiving Jedi training from the Exile. This curiosity stemmed from her having examined some of Atris\\'s [[Holocron/Legends|Jedi holocrons]], and her interest in these artifacts may have led to her taking the position of Jedi historian as Kreia predicted.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nHaving lived a relatively sheltered life in the secret academy on Telos, Brianna displayed some naïveté towards the workings of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], a fact commented on by Atton Rand. She also failed to grasp jokes made by Surik and the bounty hunter [[Mira]], as well as Rand\\'s sarcasm. Brianna tended to view things in terms of black and white, and argued with Surik over some of her decisions, feeling that any act of questionable morality was unacceptable, a mindset she likely developed from following Atris\\' own strict beliefs.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{Quote|She has always brought shame upon us.

In addition, Brianna was skilled in the use of [[Precognition/Legends|Battle Precognition]], which allowed her to perceive her opponents\\' intentions an instant before they acted, giving her an edge in combat. She recognized Surik\\'s potential with precognition and taught her to use the ability as well. Her combat prowess extended to numerous weapons including [[Force pike/Legends|Force pikes]] and blasters. Brianna also utilized a unique [[Handmaiden\\'s staff|staff]] that possessed qualities similar to a [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|saberstaff]], and was given to her by her father. Along with her various weapons, Brianna could also fight effectively unarmed due to her proficiency in Echani.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAs the daughter of a Jedi, Arren Kae, Brianna was Force-sensitive and eventually accepted Jedi training from Surik, becoming a Jedi Guardian. As a Jedi Guardian, Brianna focused on combat and learned the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] techniques and abilities of the Jedi, supplementing her skills with powers such as [[Force Jump]]. With Jedi training, her combat proficiency increased to the point where she surpassed even her sisters in skill and managed to defeat all of them together in combat. Brianna was even able to duel evenly against Jedi Master Atris for a while before being overwhelmed by Force Lightning. She also displayed significant endurance, and was able to stand after being battered by Force Lightning and seemed relatively steady despite the ordeal.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Equipment==\\nBrianna possessed many items she was given by her parents, including Jedi robes from her mother and staff from her father. The Jedi robe inherited from her mother, Arren Kae, was light-grey in color. It also provided her some improvements and protection. The staff that she inherited from her father Yusanis was similar to other staffs used by Handmaidens, having capability of being folded inside the handle.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\nBrianna first appeared in \\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', a [[video game]] produced by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] and released in [[2004]].<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Like most companions, she was written by [[Chris Avellone]].<ref name=\"15 Years\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.cinelinx.com/news/culture/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-developer-chris-avellone-discusses-the-games-impact-15-years-later/|title=Knights of the Old Republic II Developer Chris Avellone Discusses the Game\\'s Impact 15 Years Later|author=Maison, Jordan|date=2019-12-06|publisher=Cinelinx|quote=I had to write almost all the companions, except for Mandalore and Bao-Dur (who was written by Michael Chu[)]|archivedate=20191208220416}}</ref> She was the only party member not conceived visually by artist [[Brian Menze]].<ref name=\"Menze\">{{DeviantArt|url=comments/1/147112880/2809155254|text=Comment on Bao Dur by Brenze|name=[[Brian Menze]]|profile=brenze|archivedate=20210429155956}}</ref> Brianna is a non-player character who joins the player\\'s party provided that the main character is a male; if the main character is a female, Meetra Surik will instead eventually be joined by [[Mical]], \"the Disciple,\" instead, and Brianna will only appear in cutscenes on Telos.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> She was voiced by [[Grey Griffin|Grey DeLisle]], who also voiced [[Padmé Amidala/Legends|Padmé Amidala]], [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]] and [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]] in the \\'\\'[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]\\'\\' cartoon.<ref name=\"BtVA\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Grey-DeLisle/|title=Grey DeLisle|publisher=Behind the Voice Actor|archivedate=20200315030239}}</ref> Despite numerous in-game references to Brianna looking different from her sisters, and \"honoring the face of her mother,\" Brianna\\'s character texture is identical to her five sisters though her head model does have beaded strands of hair on both sides.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nWhen [[Leland Chee]] was asked if, with Surik being a female, Brianna still traveled with Surik, he answered with a simple \"maybe;\"<ref name=\"Tasty Taste answer\">{{SWBoards|url=thread.jspa?threadID=152583&start=1125|thread=Holocron continuity database questions|user=[[Leland Chee|Tasty Taste]]|date=December 28, 2006|time=04:01 PM|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303055750/http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&start=1125}}</ref> however, a preview for the [[Star Wars Miniatures]] [[Knights of the Old Republic (Star Wars Miniatures)|Knights of the Old Republic]] set confirmed that Brianna did indeed accompany Surik.

This inconsistency can most likely be attributed to the [[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']] being written from an [[in-universe]] point of view, with the [[New Jedi Order]]\\'s records on the battle being inaccurate. This explanation is further supported as the guide also references Visas Marr as another possible slayer of Nihilus.<ref name=\"EGttF\" /> A game update for the video game \\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]\\'\\' in [[2013]] later made Brianna\\'s outfit, \"The Last Handmaiden Set,\" available for purchase by players through the game\\'s Cartel Market system.<ref name=\"Blog Shipment\">{{TORweb|url=info/news/blog/20130313-0|text=Cartel Market Shipment Two: The Contraband Packs}}</ref>\\n\\n===Gameplay===\\nAs with most of the player\\'s allies, the player can wait until they have enough influence with Brianna to train her as a Jedi at a low level. Since she\\'s at level 6 when she joins Surik, she has the potential to learn more Force powers and abilities if the player waits. There is a glitch in the game which allows a male Surik to accidentally kill Brianna during her training. Upon opening the character selection screen, her space will have no picture, and the name will be replaced by the words \"I am so very very broken.\" Should the player attempt to speak to Brianna when Surik has more influence with Visas than Brianna, she will get upset and refuse to speak to him for the remainder of the game.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Dark side ending===\\n[[File:Briannadsportrait.jpg|thumb|right|Brianna with [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] alignment]]\\nDue to Meetra Surik\\'s unique ability to form close bonds with her companions and even twist their motivations to her will, Brianna can be influenced to fall to the dark side. If Brianna joins Surik and then falls to the dark side, Kreia predicts that she will stop looking up to the Jedi and give herself over to battle completely. She abandons her Force training and instead will punish the Jedi for being too emotional. Should Brianna fall to the dark side and become a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] Guardian, she also replaces her pure white clothing with a similar looking garment that is completely black and fastened with leather.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Playing as a male Surik====\\n{{Quote|I wish to see what the Handmaiden sees when she looks at you that causes her heart to race, and her tone to change.|Visas Marr|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nAlthough it was confirmed to be [[canon]] that Brianna accompanied Surik during her travels,<ref name=\"KOTOR minis preview 5\" /><ref name=\"Tasty Taste answer\" /> in the game itself, she would only accompany Surik if the player was male. Otherwise, she would be replaced by [[Mical]]. At some point Surik asked Brianna to teach her Echani fighting techniques, and over the course of their journey they sparred three times, each time learning more about each other and became closer, to the point that both Atton and Kreia would notice and comment on it.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nThe main difference in Brianna\\'s journey with a male Surik would be her development of romantic feelings towards Surik, as well as her rivalry with Visas for his affections. When Visas is first accepted into the group by Surik, Brianna challenges his choice, feeling that Visas could betray them to the Sith, and also displayed jealousy at Surik\\'s willingness to accept another woman so easily. If Surik had higher influence with Visas than Brianna, she would confront the Miraluka in jealousy, accusing her of planning to betray them to the Sith, and ignoring the latter\\'s attempts to placate her. Brianna\\'s envy would grow to the point where Kreia would take advantage of it, manipulating the handmaiden\\'s feelings and convincing her to be ready to confront Visas when Kreia felt the time was right.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nWith a male Surik, Brianna would also take Kreia to Atris, with her grief over Surik\\'s death clouding her judgment. She would confront her sisters, as well as Atris, who would eventually use Force lightning. Brianna was unprepared and thrown to her knees after one hit, but Atris tortured her with another round of lightning, her jealousy burning over Brianna\\'s closeness to Surik and accusing her of falling in love with him as Brianna laid writhing in agony. Rendered hurt and helpless, it seemed Atris was going to finish her off, when suddenly Surik appeared at the last second, and challenged Atris to a duel. Only further angered by Surik\\'s display of concern, she struck Brianna one last time with lightning and, leaving her for dead on the floor, retreated to her chamber to do battle with Surik.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAfter Surik dueled with Atris, Brianna surprisingly managed to survive the vicious assault, and now without the oath to her sisters or her mistress to hold her there, she once again pledged herself to Surik in gratitude. This time she would never let the stigma of her family hold her back from following her heart again. She renounced her title as Last of the Handmaidens, and accepted her true identity for the first time, as well as her name (which up to this point, she had kept secret even from Surik).<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Cut content===\\n[[File:Briannaportrait.jpg|thumb|right|Brianna\\'s portrait]]\\n{{Main|Cut content from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nIn an earlier version of the game, Brianna was originally meant to join Meetra Surik regardless of gender, so long as Surik was light-sided (dark sided players would have been joined by Visas Marr instead).<ref name=\"Gizka1\">{{Cite_web|url=http://forums.team-gizka.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1961&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&sid=e4aeb77a3bf178fb590cf9e39dee3e01|title=Team Gizka :: View topic - What was cut? *MAJOR SPOILAGE*, page 1|nobackup=1}} {{C|Now defunct}}</ref>\\n\\nBrianna was intended to fight her sisters in the Telos Academy, either to kill them or to stun them, letting them live.<ref name=\"Gizka1\" /> In the official release, when her sisters act hostile and it appears a fight is about to begin, the scene instead fades to black, fading back in later to show all the handmaidens save Brianna prone on the ground.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBrianna had a couple of scenes that were eventually cut out of the game: If the player had more influence with Visas Marr than the Handmaiden, or the PC was dark-sided, then Brianna would attack Marr in the [[Trayus Academy]] on [[Malachor V]], accusing her of seducing Surik. If the PC had more influence with Brianna than Visas and the Mass Shadow Generator was not activated, then the PC would leave her in the [[Trayus Core]] to wait for others and to teach them as Kreia taught Surik.<ref name=\"Gizka1\" /> Like Mira, Rand, and Marr, Brianna would be one of the members to confront and attack Kreia at Malachor V only to be defeated and imprisoned by [[Darth Sion]].

She was deeply committed to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Order]] and was a fierce adherent of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]]. But Atris\\' faith in the righteousness of the Jedi wavered when her personal hero, [[Meetra Surik]], turned her back on the Council to join rogue Knights [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]] and their [[Revanchist|faction]] of Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. Atris chose not to go to war, but this decision left her bitter and conflicted.\\n\\nWhen Surik returned to face the Council\\'s judgment after the devastating events of the [[Battle of Malachor V]], Atris was the first to condemn her, suggesting that she had fallen to the dark side just as Revan had. Over time, Atris grew to hate Surik for complicating her black-and-white view of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. During the [[Dark Wars]], Atris called a secret Jedi [[Conclave at Katarr|convocation]] on the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] world of [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]] in an attempt to find the threat that was stalking the Jedi. She then leaked knowledge of the conclave\\'s existence in the hopes of drawing out the Sith. She succeeded, but with dire consequences; [[Darth Nihilus]] devastated the surface of the planet, wiping out all life on Katarr, including the Jedi gathered there.\\n\\nHowever, Atris survived, and she remained in seclusion, surrounding herself with [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] [[Handmaiden Sisters|Handmaidens]] who could not feel the Force. She planned to rebuild the Jedi Order, and established a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]] in the old irrigation system on [[Telos IV]]. However, she was heavily influenced by the many [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]] she had collected in her efforts to find and understand the Sith. The holocrons fed her bitterness, and she slowly and quietly fell to the dark side, consequently becoming the new \\'\\'\\'Darth Traya\\'\\'\\', the \\'\\'\\'Queen of Betrayal\\'\\'\\'. Per the machinations of her mentor, [[Kreia]], Surik and the new [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Traya confronted each other once more on Telos, where Surik convinced Atris to turn away from the dark side.

She argued that there was little wonder why Kun and Qel-Droma fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], when the Jedi had liberal instruction practices in place, such as dozens of [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] training under a single Master, the radical bonds of reciprocal apprenticeship, and Jedi beginning their training in their teens and later. She invoked thousand-year old recommendations first suggested by the Jedi Master [[Simikarty]], lobbying for the restriction of Padawans that a Master could have at one time, and also limiting the age of Jedi candidates.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\\n\\nAtris also advocated prohibiting romantic involvement for Jedi, citing that the [[First Great Schism]] had been started by two lovers. She even endorsed adoption of a more austere interpretation of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] which was favored by the [[Draethos (species)|Draethos]] Jedi Master [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]], in memory of his death at the hands of Exar Kun at the Jedi Academy on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]].

Many followed them, including the Jedi [[Meetra Surik]]. Atris had held a strong admiration for Surik, viewing her as something of a hero as well as a close friend. When she and Revan left the Order to join the war, rejecting everything that Atris believed in, Atris felt personally betrayed.<ref name=\"FMWA\" /> Atris condemned Revan, his followers, and the \"freethinking\" teachings of his former Jedi Master, fellow historian [[Kreia]].

Surik was so defiant, so certain of the rightness of her actions that she caused Atris to doubt herself. Atris wanted to punish Surik for this, and became convinced that she had fallen to the dark side along with all of the others who had followed Revan. She felt that exile was too lenient of a punishment for Surik\\'s betrayal, and believed that she would only join Revan again if she was free. The other Masters warned her to be mindful of her feelings, but Atris insisted that Surik ought to have died at Malachor V, because when she stood before them, it was if she was already dead. The Council decided not to tell Surik that she had become a [[wound in the Force]], which was the result of her actions at Malachor.<ref name=\"FMWA\" />\\n\\nAtris kept [[Meetra Surik\\'s first lightsaber|Surik\\'s lightsaber]] after the trial, carrying it with her always.

Unfortunately, she greatly underestimated its strength. The Sith arrived in the form of [[Darth Nihilus]], who proved to be too powerful for the Jedi. Through the Force, he devoured all life on the planet, including the Jedi and Miraluka (with the single exception of [[Visas Marr]], whom he later took as his apprentice). Atris, having not attended the Conclave, survived, along with a handful of other Masters who went into hiding.<ref name=\"CotOR\">\\'\\'[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nAtris took refuge under a polar ice cap on the planet [[Telos IV]], where she began to build a secret [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi academy]] in an old irrigation system.

To that end, she trained [[Handmaiden Sisters|a group of half-sisters]], specially equipped and trained to resist [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] and, if necessary, use their [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] combat skills to subdue wayward Jedi. Atris planned to eventually rebuild the Jedi Order, but she greatly overestimated her own ability to resist the dark side, becoming corrupted by delving into the forbidden knowledge of her collection of Sith holocrons.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Reunion with Meetra Surik====\\n{{Quote|I did not expect to see you again after the day of your sentencing. I thought you had taken the exile\\'s path, wandering the galaxy. Yet you have returned - why?|Atris, to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nIn [[3951 BBY]], Meetra Surik and her companions landed on Telos IV, having narrowly escaped the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction]] of the [[Peragus Mining Facility]] at [[Peragus II]]. Upon hearing that the [[Telos Security Force]] held an individual called the Jedi Exile and her party under house arrest for their suspected involvement in the explosion of the mining facility, Atris desired to uncover the cause of the explosion, knowing that the consequences of its loss would be tremendous. Therefore, she sent one of her Handmaidens by the name of [[Brianna]], to steal their ship, the \\'\\'[[Ebon Hawk]]\\'\\', as well as [[T3-M4]] who, fortunately for her, was on board. The ship and droid were dissected for information, though little of value was actually found.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n[[File:Atristrial.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A holorecord of Atris at the Jedi Exile\\'s trial.]]\\nUpon discovering the loss of her ship, Surik managed to [[Skirmish on Telos|trace]] the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' to the polar plateau where Atris\\'s academy was hidden. Once she found her way inside, Atris had Surik\\'s companions placed in [[force cage]]s while the Handmaidens brought Meetra Surik before her to be questioned. Not long before this, Atris had discovered Surik\\'s identity, and was surprised at the revelation&mdash;she had not expected to see her again after the Council sentenced her to Exile.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAt first she hoped that Surik had returned to admit that the Council had been right and to face up to her crimes, but that was not the case. Surik\\'s presence stirred unpleasant feelings which Atris had all but forgotten, and hoped lost. These feelings showed themselves when she accused Meetra Surik of walking the dark path, when Atris\\' words were the ones that sounded bitter and resentful. In fact, she was so angry about what Surik did that she refused to believe that Surik had meant to help others in the Mandalorian Wars, and said she simply went off for the adventure and the excitement of battle. Atris continued to berate Surik by blaming her for the destruction of Peragus II. She was shocked to learn the Sith were behind it, and even more shocked when she learned the Sith were hunting Meetra Surik. She reluctantly accepted Surik\\'s offer of help in defeating them, and instructed her to gather other Jedi on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] so that action could be taken and a Council could be had.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAfter departing Telos IV, Surik discovered that T3-M4 had downloaded Atris\\'s archives. It seemed that Atris had kept a holo record of her trial, as well as a list of the remaining [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]&mdash;despite her claim that she was the \"last of the Jedi\" because T3 had been able to slice into the historian\\'s files and copy them, locating the Jedi Masters for Atris\\'s proposed meeting proved easier.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Admission and letting go====\\nAs Atris sought desperately to understand Surik\\'s motives, which was part of the reason for her keeping of the [[Holocron/Legends|holocrons]], she clung even more desperately to her perfect view of the Jedi. However, in light of Surik\\'s choices, she knew that either she or the Council was wrong. Though she placed Surik in the wrong, it only made her more unsettled, as, inwardly, she respected her choice. It built up a pressure that finally exploded when Kreia, who had then revealed her former identity as Darth Traya after she had killed the three Council members [[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Kavar]], and [[Vrook Lamar]] when they reconvened on Dantooine, stripped Atris of her self-denials and allowed her to finally accepting that she was betrayed by her dark persona; Atris embraced herself as Darth Traya,<ref name=\"Admission\">\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', When Kreia speaks to Atris while in her meditation chamber.</ref> the Queen of Betrayal,<ref name=\"TSLOSG\">\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]\\'\\'</ref> and was told by Kreia that Meetra Surik would return to her sanctum on Telos to confront her for the last time.<ref name=\"Admission\" />\\n\\nAfter being informed by an Onderonian colonel named [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] of the Jedi academy on Telos, who had been in turn informed by Kreia, Darth Nihilus attacked Telos, believing that he could feed on what Jedi were there.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nWhen Surik, who was searching for Kreia after having been left by the former Sith, returned to the Academy, Darth Traya [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|clashed]] with her in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]], and was defeated.

Though she claimed to be building a Jedi Academy, she made no efforts to bring Force-sensitives to train.

One possible ending featured Kreia\\'s redemption and Atris\\'s total shift to the dark side, which culminated in the scene where Atris attacked the player wearing a black robe and claimed that she, not Kreia, was Darth Traya. Her dark side model remained in the PC version of the game and can appear in the main menu if the CurSithLord option is set to 1 in swkotor2.ini.

If the KOTOR Save Editor is used, the code for her dark side model is Unique_Darth_Traya, indicating she was meant to become the new Darth Traya.\\n\\nLater on, the dark side model of Atris (see above) was planned to be put in the final game for the confrontation with Atris, but it was removed a few weeks before the game was released, with the reason that the presence of the dark side model was confusing the game testers.\\n\\n==Appearances==\\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Atris}}\\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 9|\\'\\'Knights of the Old Republic\\'\\' 9]]\\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|\\'\\'Knights of the Old Republic\\'\\' 29]]\\n*\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'\\n*[[The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)|\\'\\'The Old Republic: Revan\\'\\' audiobook]]\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\' {{1st}}\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]\\'\\' {{Mo}}\\n*[[Cartel Market|\\'\\'Star Wars: The Old Republic\\'\\' Cartel Market]] {{C|Outfit}}\\n\\n==Sources==\\n*\\'\\'[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]\\'\\' {{1stm}}\\n*\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[The New Essential Chronology]]\\'\\' {{ID|Darth Traya}}\\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']]\\n*\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]\\'\\' {{Po}}\\n\\n==Notes and references==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n{{CouncilMandWar}}\\n\\n{{CouncilAMandWar}}\\n\\n{{Start box}}\\n{{Succession box\\n|title=[[Chief Librarian/Legends|Chief Librarian]] of the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]]\\n|years=[[3954 BBY]]&ndash;[[3951 BBY]]\\n|before=Unknown\\n|after=Eventually [[Ostar-Gal]]\\n}}\\n{{End box}}\\n\\n{{Interlang\\n|da=Atris\\n|de=Atris#legends\\n|es=Atris\\n|fr=Atris\\n|hu=Atris\\n|pl=Atris\\n|pt=Atris\\n|ru=Эйтрис\\n|deFA=1\\n}}\\n\\n[[Category:Darths]]\\n[[Category:Females]]\\n[[Category:Humans]]\\n[[Category:Jedi High Council members]]\\n[[Category:Lore Keepers]]\\n[[Category:Lost Jedi (Jedi Order)]]\\n[[Category:Redeemed Jedi]]'),\n Row(id=22, title='Meetra Surik', text='{{Top|sprot|ffa|canon=Surik}}\\n{{Otheruses|Surik}}\\n{{Character\\n|type=Jedi\\n|image=[[File:JediExileTOR.png]]\\n|name=Meetra Surik<br />\"Jedi Exile\"\\n|homeworld=[[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]<ref>\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', Conversation with [[Dillan]] on Dantooine&mdash;the Exile grew up there, although her birth place is unknown</ref>\\n|birth=Roughly ten [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before [[Bastila Shan]]<ref name=\"Revan\">\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n|death=[[3950 BBY]], [[Dromund Kaas]]<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n|species=[[Human/Legends|Human]]<ref name=\"Revan\" /><ref name=\"KotOR CG\">\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n|gender=<!-- The Jedi Exile is canonically female, as per the New Essential Guide to Droids and the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide.

As a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], she chose to disobey the orders of the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] and aid the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in its war against the invading [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Neo-Crusaders]]. Rising to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] during the conflict, she served with distinction under the command of her fellow [[Revanchist|Crusaders]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]] and was eventually commissioned as a [[Jedi General/Legends|General]] in the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]]. Surik played a vital role in defeating the Mandalorians during the latter stages of the conflict, but as a direct result of her controversial actions during the cataclysmic [[Battle of Malachor V|final battle]], she effectively [[Wound in the Force|cut]] her connection to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Afterwards, out of all those who went to war, she was the only Jedi to avoid the call of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and return to the Jedi Council to be judged for her crimes. After being exiled from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], she wandered the periphery of known space for nearly a decade before returning to the Republic during the [[Dark Wars]], at the height of the [[First Jedi Purge]].\\n\\nCaught up in the schemes of various mysterious factions, she was swiftly drawn into the ongoing conflict and became instrumental in engineering the defeat of the [[Sith Triumvirate]], ruled by [[Darth Nihilus]], [[Darth Sion]] and [[Kreia|Darth Traya]]. With both her [[Force-sensitive/Legends|connection]] to the [[The Force/Legends|Force]] and the Jedi Order restored, Surik emerged victorious from her campaign against the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]], and immediately began a search for the long absent Jedi Revan. She eventually found Revan imprisoned on [[Dromund Kaas]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world of a [[Sith Empire (Post–Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]], believed to have been destroyed over a thousand years prior. Surik joined Revan in his mission to kill the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor]], who had been plotting an invasion of the Republic for centuries. She, Revan and Lord [[Scourge (Sith)|Scourge]] joined forces in their common cause and [[Attack on the Sith Emperor|attacked]] the Emperor. However, Scourge seemingly betrayed his Jedi allies and stabbed Surik from behind, killing her instantly. Her death helped Revan in delaying the Emperor and his plans.\\n\\nSurik did not become one with the Force at the time of her death; instead, her [[Force ghost|spirit]] stayed with Revan and helped him to endure the horrors of his imprisonment in stasis. In the following years after her physical demise, the [[Lost Jedi|Jedi]] that she [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] during her travels proved essential to the process of rebuilding the Jedi Order, in the wake of its near annihilation due to the machinations of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. When the Sith Emperor finally [[Great Galactic War|unleashed]] his army against the Republic three centuries later, Surik\\'s spirit instructed Jedi Master [[Oteg]] to dispatch a team to free Revan from his prison on [[Taral V]]. After urging Revan to fulfill his objective and destroy the Emperor, Surik disappeared. Years later, Surik later joined with the legendary [[Alliance Commander]] and many of history\\'s greatest champions to battle the reassembling vestiges of Vitiate\\'s essence, destroying the Emperor once and for all.

It was requested she be given status as a diplomatic passenger and escorted to [[Telos IV]], though it was made clear that she was to be given no special treatment nor to make any indications of her identity.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nDuring the trip to Telos, the ship received a distress call from a low-stock [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]], claiming to be engaged in a firefight with a Sith warship. When the \\'\\'Harbinger\\'\\' arrived, they found the ship derelict; after the crew boarded the vessel they found it to be empty, save for the battered body of [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sion]]. The \\'\\'[[Ebon Hawk]]\\'\\', a small freighter that once had played a major role in the Jedi Civil War, also seemingly deserted, was picked up as well. In the next few days, crew aboard the ship began to disappear; when Darth Sion finally awoke, saying that he had come for the Jedi, [[Stealth suit/Legends|cloaked]] [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassins]] revealed themselves and slaughtered the ship\\'s crew \"en masse.\" In the ensuing chaos, it went unnoticed that an [[HK-50 series assassin droid]] unit had drugged Surik and sealed her away. As the ship died around them, a former Jedi Master named Kreia&mdash;who was the exiled Sith Lord [[Kreia|Darth Traya]]<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />&mdash;found Surik, brought her back to the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' and attempted to flee. Unfortunately, they attracted the attention of the now fully-operational warship, which fired on the freighter, damaging it severely and nearly killing both Surik and Kreia. With the help of the utility droid [[T3-M4]], Surik was taken care of and the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' was guided to the nearby [[Peragus Mining Facility]].<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n[[File:KnightInShiningUnderwear-K2.png|thumb|right|250px|Surik encountered Atton Rand  in the Peragus Mining Facility, and would later train him in the Jedi arts.]]\\nWhen Surik awoke from her torpor in the mining facility\\'s medlab, she found Kreia unconscious. After Kreia awoke and told Surik that they had to find a way off the station, she found the facility to be completely abandoned except for malfunctioning mining droids, which attacked Surik on sight. To add to the mystery, Surik\\'s severed Force connection slowly began to return; while searching for a way off the station she found a male [[scoundrel]] named [[Atton Rand]], who was imprisoned within a [[force cage]] in the station\\'s brig. After Darth Sion and a group of Sith Assassins arrived on the \\'\\'Harbinger\\'\\' intending to kill Surik, believing she was the last of the Jedi, the three escaped with T3-M4 aboard the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\', but not before Sion sliced off Kreia\\'s left hand. They then traveled to Telos, since it was the only available destination in the Peragus facility\\'s navigational charts. While being pursued by the Sith in the asteroid field around Peragus, laser fire from the hijacked warship ignited the volatile fuel within the asteroids. The resulting explosion destroyed both the facility and the planet itself, though the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' and the Sith on board the \\'\\'Harbinger\\'\\' were able to escape.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nWhen Surik and her crew arrived at the massive [[Citadel Station]] in orbit around Telos IV, the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' and T3-M4 were stolen and brought to the Telosian surface where they were held for questioning about the Peragus explosion. After a Telosian investigation proved their innocence, they were asked by Lieutenant [[Dol Grenn]] to stay on-station until the Republic\\'s inquiry was complete. Instead, Surik allied herself with the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Force Adept]] [[Chodo Habat]], eventually [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|gathering]] enough evidence to expose [[Jana Lorso]], the executive of the [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka]] outpost on the Citadel Station. After gathering the necessary evidence to bring Lorso down, and after Surik [[Skirmish in the Ithorian Compound|saved]] Habat from mercenaries hired by Czerka to kill him and his herd, he allowed Surik and her companions to use one of their shuttles to reach Telos\\' surface, where they were [[Skirmish on Telos|shot down]] by a Czerka [[air defense tower]]. An [[Iridonian/Legends|Iridonian]] [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] engineer named [[Bao-Dur]], who had designed the Mass Shadow Generator and served under Surik at Malachor V, saw the crash and pulled the three unharmed from the wreckage.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n[[File:Telos_academy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Arriving at Telos IV, Surik discovered a secret Jedi academy ran by Jedi Master Atris.]]\\nWhile on the surface, they learned that the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' had been taken to the old planetary aqueducts in the polar region of the planet. Commandeering a shuttle from an abandoned [[Telosian Military Base|military compound]], Surik and her companions traveled to the aqueducts and found Jedi Master Atris there, a former member of the Council that sentenced Surik into exile. Atris was attempting to recover lost Jedi teachings and had surrounded herself with several [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] [[Handmaiden Sisters|sisters]]. These sisters, known as [[Handmaiden]]s, had vowed \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' to learn the ways of the Jedi. After a heated debate over what the Jedi should have done during the Mandalorian Wars, Surik and her party left with the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' and T3-M4. When they left, T3-M4 revealed that he had managed to download Atris\\'s database while being held, including a recording of Surik\\'s trial and records of where the last five remaining Jedi Masters were hiding: Atris on Telos, Kavar on Onderon, [[Vrook Lamar]] on Dantooine, Zez-Kai Ell on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], and [[Lonna Vash]] on the Sith tombworld [[Korriban]]. Coincidentally, although Kreia believed otherwise, these were the same five Jedi on the Council that cast Surik out of the Order to become the Exile. However, Brianna was ordered by Atris to sneak aboard the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' and aid Surik in her mission in order to monitor her activities and in order to confirm that Surik still served the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|Light side of the Force]]. The crew, together with its newest member, went off to these worlds in search of the Jedi in an attempt to unite them against the Sith and to find the answers as to why Surik was sentenced to exile.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n[[File:Visas_Ebon_Hawk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The apprentice of Darth Nihilus, Visas Marr switched her allegiance to the Exile after Surik defeated her in battle.]]\\nDuring her adventures, Surik met many beings who became her companions. She found many of them to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], and thus she trained them in the Jedi ways. During this time the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Nihilus]] had sent his [[Shadow Hand]], the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] [[Visas Marr]], to [[Duel on the Ebon Hawk|assassinate]] Surik. However, after a brief [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]] she was able to redeem Marr, accepting her into the ship\\'s crew and retraining her in the ways of a [[Jedi Sentinel/Legends|Jedi Sentinel]]. With Marr gained as an ally, Surik knew she could not hide her presence for long, however she also knew that she had an inroad into finding at least one of the Sith Lords who hunted her. Surik also helped Bao-Dur overcome his guilt over the lives lost at the Battle of Malachor V, and trained him in the ways of a [[Jedi Guardian]]. When two Twi\\'leks on Nar Shaddaa warned Surik about Atton Rand - saying he was a killer and not just a soldier - she approached Rand about this. Initially upset about being asked about his past, Rand however revealed his past as a soldier under the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars, and as a Sith trooper during the Jedi Civil War. He told her that he decided to leave the Sith after he killed [[Unidentified female Jedi (Atton Rand)|a female Jedi]], with whom he fell in love, after she showed him the Force.

After completing [[Skirmish on Dxun|various tasks]], the Mandalorian leader on Dxun, [[Canderous Ordo|Mandalore the Preserver]], allowed Surik to take one of their shuttles to [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], the capital of Onderon. After gaining contact with Jedi Master Kavar in the Iziz Cantina, Tobin interrupted the meeting, forcing Kavar to flee, but not without promising to contact her when he was able. Surik and Mandalore killed Tobin\\'s forces that attacked them in the cantina and the western square, and proceeded to leave the city. After they returned to Dxun, Mandalore joined Surik not only because he felt she need an ally against the Sith, but because he intended to look for Mandalorian clans on other worlds so that he could reunite them under \"his\" leadership.

Azkul asked Surik to join him and take over Khoonda; however, she refused, and he left, ordering the mercenaries accompanying him to kill her. After defeating them, she returned to Khoonda, bolstered its defenses and finalized the battle plans with the local [[Khoonda Militia|militia]] leader, [[Zherron]].

She traveled to Dxun, where Kelborn told her that Vaklu met with the Council of Lords, and had them declare [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]], who was his cousin, guilty of [[Treason/Legends|treason]]. Kreia sensed something stirring on Dxun, and asked Kelborn whether or not they picked up anything on their sensors. Kelborn confirmed that they had, and Surik sent three members of her crew to deal with the Sith forces at the [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|tomb]] of the ancient Sith Lord [[Freedon Nadd]].

He said that he knew her teacher, Kreia, and of the fires that raged on Dxun while the Republic died around her. Sion further stated that she knew of war and battle, and said that he knew of Malachor. Sion said that Surik knew what it meant to be broken, and warned her that Kreia would destroy her as she had destroyed him and said that he could end her suffering at Kreia\\'s hands before it began. With these words, Surik and her companions [[Duel in the Korriban Academy (First Jedi Purge)|fought]] the Lord of Pain, striking him down multiple times. However, the Dark Lord would recover from the fatal injuries and keep fighting. Through the Force, Kreia informed Surik that Sion was not a beast of flesh and blood, and that it was not a battle that could be won. She told her that while there would be another opportunity, now was not the right time&mdash;not while Korriban ran through Sion. Surik thanked Kreia for the information, and she and her companions fled the Sith Academy.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nWhile exploring the [[Shyrack/Legends|shyrack]] [[Shyrack cave|cave]] near the Sith Academy, she found the hidden [[Tomb of Ludo Kressh|tomb]] of the Sith Lord [[Ludo Kressh]]. When she went inside, Surik was forced to confront many of her own personality traits as well as many of her past choices and regrets. This took the form of a series of visions, during which she witnessed a twisted version of when she was recruited by Malak, a recollection of her actions during the second battle of Dxun, an illusionary confrontation between Kreia and various members of her party, and finally a silent apparition of Darth Revan, with whom she did battle. During these sequences, much of her character was revealed, determined by her choices.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n[[File:RevanForceDrain.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kreia destroyed the High Council before they could close a wound in the Force which they identified as the Exile.]]\\nAfter locating and conversing with all of the remaining Jedi Masters, Surik returned to Dantooine to find the rebuilt Jedi Enclave. There, Masters Lamar, Kavar, and Ell had formed a Council in which they would decide her fate. The Masters concluded that, through her actions at Malachor V, she had become a wound in the Force. They stated that she carried the deaths of all who died in the battle within her, and that she regained her connection to the Force by feeding on death and leeching the life energy of her companions. According to the Masters, the Sith had learned their ability to feed on the Force from her, and thus she was a threat to all living beings, and possibly the Force itself, and in time she might possess the same magnitude of power like Darth Nihilus and ultimately consume the galaxy, which wasn\\'t true. However, they deemed it necessary that she be stripped of the Force with or without her consent; she submitted to their sentence. Having re-established her previous sentence of exile, they attempted to strip her of the Force, but before they could finish, Kreia stormed into the meeting to save Surik at the last moment. Surik, still under her [[Force Stun|stasis]] established by the reconvened Jedi Council, was left helpless and watched as Kreia, who revealed her identity as the former Sith Lord Darth Traya, used the Force to [[Force drain/Legends|drain]] the Jedi Masters of their powers, putting them through the same suffering Surik had felt on Malachor V.

In order to save Brianna, Surik was thus forced to [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|confront]] Atris, who had fallen to the dark side and, in Kreia\\'s words, become a Darth Traya. After Surik defeated Atris, the victor persuaded the fallen Jedi Master to forgive her and helped Atris see the folly of her beliefs. Atris then told Surik that Kreia had fled to Malachor V to wait for her there for a final confrontation, and confirmed her identity as one of the Lords of the Sith, one of those that had murdered the Jedi. After the duel, Brianna pledged her allegiance to Surik, renouncing her title of Last of the Handmaidens, and embracing her true name. Surik then left Atris in the Academy until her role in nearly destroying the Jedi could be judged by Surik\\'s apprentice Mical and the new Jedi Council. Shortly thereafter, Surik participated in the [[Battle of Telos IV]] and faced off with Darth Nihilus on the bridge of his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] [[Ravager (Centurion-class)|\\'\\'Ravager\\'\\']] to keep him from destroying Telos, which he was doing to fuel his hunger for the Force.

But Kreia would not have it; though she was warmed by the thought that her former pupil would still care enough to try and \"save\" her. She vowed that this confrontation could only end in death, and that if Surik would not fight her, she would break her as she did Sion. After a fierce but short battle, Surik severed Kreia\\'s remaining hand, as well as their [[Force bond]] in a single stroke. Satisfied that their bond would soon be no more, Kreia requested at Surik to finish her. However, Meetra Surik chose not to violate the symbiosis of life and the Force; the Jedi Exile did not kill her mentor.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nEnraged that Surik was not letting go, Kreia continued to battle by [[Telekinesis/Legends|animating]] three lightsabers to do battle for her through the Force, until Surik had no choice but to strike her down. Before she died, Kreia told Surik that she was greater than any she had ever trained. In her final moments, Kreia gave Surik information about Revan\\'s location in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]], and about the future fates of Surik\\'s allies; the planets they had visited, and the future of the Republic. Shortly after Kreia\\'s death, [[Bao-Dur\\'s remote]] reactivated the Mass Shadow Generator in order to completely destroy the planet.

In contrast to the feelings of horror in death that she could feel at Malachor V, Nathema was just \\'\\'dead\\'\\'. The once-populated, once-agricultural world had no living things of any kind anywhere on the planet, and the whole world was a dead spot in the Force. Surik and T3 located a government building and sliced into its network to retrieve files on the nature of the planet. After returning to the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\', Surik fled the system as fast as the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' would fly before pouring over the information that T3 had retrieved. She quickly learned that the world had survived the end of the Great Hyperspace War, and had been ruled by a being of immense power known as Lord [[Tenebrae|Vitiate]].<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\nAfter the war, she read, Vitiate had called many of the surviving Sith leaders to his world to discuss the future of their kind. The Sith Lords had arrived on Nathema, but shortly afterward all records of every kind ceased to be recorded. Surik surmised that Vitiate had invited the other Sith Lords to his planet as a trap, and once they arrived, had enacted the Sith sorcery that had destroyed the world. Through fortunate happenstance, Surik also learned that Vitiate had had his people searching for Dromund Kaas, a long-lost colony world of the Sith. With T3\\'s expert slicing skills, they were able to determine both the location of the world as well as a safe hyperspace route. With this knowledge, the pair set course for the unknown world and left Nathema silent once more.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\nThe \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' was able to land on Dromund Kaas without incident; the capital of the [[Sith Empire (Post–Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] evidently believing itself invulnerable to attack or infiltration, since the Empire had been unknown to the Republic for over a millennium. Through several intermediaries she was able to buy off, Surik was finally able to arrange a meeting with the Sith from T3\\'s recording. Though the meeting was initially marred by a skirmish in which Surik slayed the four soldiers he had brought along as escort, she found herself in the curious position of having a civil&mdash;if tense&mdash;conversation with Scourge. He informed her that Revan was a prisoner of his own master, [[Darth Nyriss]], and that Revan had foretold of her coming to rescue him. The two eventually agreed to an alliance of convenience, because they shared the common goal of stopping the Sith Emperor\\'s plan to invade the Republic.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\n[[File:Revan_and_T3-M4_TERC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Surik succeeded in returning Revan\\'s mask to its owner, and the Prodigal Knight resolved to protect the galaxy by destroying the Sith.]]\\nSurik agreed to wait while Scourge arranged circumstances where they would best be able to free Revan from captivity. With his own intelligence and resources, Scourge schemed to destroy Darth Nyriss by exposing her and the other [[Dark Council]] members\\' intrigues against the Emperor to him. The Emperor\\'s retaliation was swift and brutal. Surik and Scourge were able to take advantage of the chaos as the elite [[Imperial Guard]] units assaulted Nyriss\\' personal compound, killing every soldier, charge, and slave loyal to the traitorous Sith lady. Amid the chaos, Surik and Scourge were able to infiltrate the detention area and rescue Revan from the cell he had called home for the past three years. In the moments before leaving the detention area, Surik remembered that she was still carrying Revan\\'s mask and presented it to him. He had a brief moment of recognition before passing out from the flood of his life\\'s memories returning to him. In those vulnerable minutes, Darth Nyriss entered the detention area with the intent of killing Revan. Surik and Scourge were forced to fight Darth Nyriss on their own.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\nThe ensuing battle was entirely one-sided&mdash;Surik and Scourge, despite their formidable skills, were no match for a member of the Dark Council. In what seemed sure to be their final moments, Surik witnessed a reborn Revan intervene and destroy Nyriss by turning her own powers against her. Together, the three escaped the dead Sith lady\\'s compound and began to prepare for their mission to destroy the Emperor. After escaping the warzone of Darth Nyriss\\' compound, the trio of Jedi and Sith learned that the Emperor had done far more than move against her. He had seized upon the opportunity to [[Purge of the Dark Council|exterminate]] \\'\\'every\\'\\' member of the Dark Council, as well as to declare martial law on the planet until the situation was resolved. The small conspiracy reasoned it likely that the Emperor was purging the Council as a pretext for replacing its members with lackeys who would not defy his plot to attack the Republic. Revan, Scourge, and Surik decided to spend the night in hiding and await daybreak, hoping that many of the soldiers would be resting or tired out after a long night of battles and massacres. Overnight, Scourge experienced his first-ever [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]]: seeing himself and his Jedi allies broken and defeated at the feet of the Emperor.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\n===Final confrontation===\\n[[File:RevanconfrontsSithEmperor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The actions of Lord Scourge resulted in Surik\\'s death and Revan\\'s capture by the Sith Emperor.]]\\nWith Scourge\\'s aid, the three were able to infiltrate the [[Imperial Citadel (Sith Empire)|Imperial Citadel]] in [[Kaas City]]. As Scourge had provided the information that allowed the Emperor to act against the Dark Council, they faced little challenge from the Imperial Guards protecting the palace. The ruse was ended when the Guard captain finally saw Revan\\'s mask, recognizing him as the man who had tried to infiltrate the Citadel years earlier. A battle quickly broke out between the trio of unlikely allies and the formidable and fanatically devoted Imperial Guards. Surik and Scourge continued to battle the guards as Revan pressed on into the throne room to [[Attack on the Sith Emperor|challenge]] the Sith Emperor himself. Even though they were outnumbered by skilled opponents, both Scourge and Surik prevailed over the guards and turned to join the fight against the Emperor himself.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\nSurik saw that the Emperor had all but defeated Revan without even drawing a weapon. She charged to his aid even as Revan was still reeling from being electrocuted by the Emperor\\'s dark powers. Seeing the Emperor take Revan\\'s own lightsaber and prepare to kill him with it, Surik made a choice which would have galactic consequences for centuries to come; rather than throw her lightsaber to kill the distracted Emperor at the cost of Revan\\'s life, she threw her blade only to deflect the killing blow. It was in this moment that the battle was lost, and Lord Scourge realized that the only way to challenge the Emperor\\'s plot against the Republic was to make it appear as though he had brought the Jedi before the Emperor as a trap for the servants of the Light. Taking advantage of her trust, Scourge stabbed Meetra Surik in the back with his lightsaber, ending her life.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\n===Post-mortem===\\n{{Quote|Your strength fails.

Ultimately, the Sith Emperor was vanquished as all those who he had manipulated and killed over the centuries, Surik included, manifested behind the Alliance Commander to aid in their fight.

My most trusted ally.|Revan|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\\n[[File:Meetra_Surik.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A young human female, Meetra Surik inspired loyalty and devotion in her followers.]]\\nThroughout her life, Surik formed bonds with her comrades, even those who were supposedly her superiors or lesser in rank. It was said that during her training, many fellow Padawans were quick to do whatever she did, and that others disliked her intensely.<ref name=\"Holovid\" /> She was regarded as a natural leader and a quick learner as well as generous and kind, though beyond this the personality of her early life is largely unknown.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" /> In the wake of the Mandalorian Wars, Surik returned to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to answer for her actions. She was fully aware of what she had done, and tried one last time to convince the Jedi Council of the rightness of her&mdash;and by extension Revan and Malak\\'s&mdash;actions. Despite her conviction and understanding of the consequences, she was exiled; in defiance, she stabbed her lightsaber into the center stone of the Council chambers when asked to surrender it. After her departure, her former Master Kavar mentioned that there was much defiance in her.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nFollowing the exile\\'s path, she forsook the company of others, preferring to wander about the Outer Rim in solitude. The wars had left many scars on her, both physical and mental, and she was left with a feeling of regret for what she had done and what she had been asked to do. During her exile, when she heard of the war started by Revan, she wondered if she could have been so blind or if the galaxy was so truly incomprehensible. She then retreated further into herself, forsaking all Jedi principles excluding one: no attachments.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> She disliked having to speak about the war, even after returning to the Republic and traveling amongst friends. She was even uncomfortable discussing the war and its end with Bao-Dur, her old friend from the war. Her wanderings served to maintain the discipline she had built up during her years of training and suffering the hardships of war.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nStarting with her meeting of Kreia in the Peragus facility, Surik began once more to form bonds with people she met during her travels, people with whom she had an interest in helping to keep alive so that they, in turn, could protect her. Eventually she began to realize the leadership role she was destined for, embracing it in order to train the Force-sensitives in her company to become the foundation of the new Jedi Order. Also during this Surik saw it as her duty to help stabilize the Republic in any way possible, reflecting her old sense of compassion and generosity that had initially driven her to war. Because of her experiences in the Mandalorian Wars, she also understood the nature of war and battle and the hard choices that had to be made when conflict was inevitable.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n==Equipment==\\nSurik dressed in simple [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]], and possessed a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] pistol, an [[Meetra Surik\\'s armband|armband]], and a self-built<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> [[Meetra Surik\\'s second lightsaber|lightsaber]] containing a cyan [[Lightsaber crystal|crystal]],<ref>\\'\\'[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]\\'\\', By using [[:File:Exilefemale2.jpg]], a screenshot provided by a Wookieepedia user, the publishers of \\'\\'The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\\'\\' have canonically established that the Jedi Surik used a cyan lightsaber</ref> like the [[Meetra Surik\\'s first lightsaber|one]] she used during the Mandalorian Wars.<ref>\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', During the conversation with Atton Rand aboard the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' about her lightsaber, she says that it had been so long that she had forgotten its color.

Bao-Dur, the Zabrak [[tech specialist]] who served under Surik during the Mandalorian Wars, aided in its construction, having learned the subtleties in the time he spent around Jedi. The blade found an excellent focusing crystal when Surik visited the Crystal Cave on Dantooine, where she harvested a [[Meetra Surik crystal|crystal]] with very rare properties. The crystal responded to her, drawing on Force energy which radiated from her body and strengthening her in turn, in the way of a Force bond. The bond was such that the crystal matured as Meetra\\'s strength in the Force grew, and it would respond to her alone, making the blade unusable by anyone else. Kreia would help Surik tune the crystal periodically so that it would best reflect her current self.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{Quote|You are a cipher, forming bonds, leeching the life of others, siphoning their will and dominating them.

Most notable to everyone around her however, was her unusual ability to influence others, and the Jedi Masters believed that she could form bonds through the Force easily to those around her, an ability she was not consciously aware of.<ref>\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', Conversation with Mical accessible via influence</ref> After reconnecting with the Force, this ability became stronger. Simply by observing another in action, Surik could instantly learn Force techniques and lightsaber forms that would take a Jedi Master years to perfect. It was believed by Masters Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar, and Vrook Lamar that this was because of the wound in the Force that surrounded her, which allowed her—like Darth Nihilus—to feed on the death of other life forms to sustain her Force powers. This wound was caused by the Battle of Malachor V, and was what originally blocked her connection to the Force. It was also because of the nature of such wounds to feed on death that Surik began to regain her Force connection on Peragus II, after all the personnel were killed by HK-50\\'s machinations.{{Fact}} When Surik traveled the galaxy, killing hundreds in her search for the Masters, she unconsciously fed on all that death, fuelling her powers. It was this that caused the Masters such fear&mdash;both at her trial and after she had united them on Dantooine&mdash;as they thought her condition to be not only a threat to the Jedi and the Force, but a threat to life itself.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n[[File:Exilefemale2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Surik was skilled in the art of lightsaber combat as well as various Force techniques.]]\\nThrough her informal apprenticeship to Kreia, Surik was able to learn a number of rare and advanced Jedi techniques, including [[Breath control]] and [[Animal bond|Beast trick]]. Kreia also taught Surik a powerful form of mind reading, where one could read the innermost thoughts of another. Kreia was very impressed with the speed in which she learned this power. She said that most Jedi Masters studied many years to learn the technique. Surik was also proficient in other Force powers, including [[Force valor]], [[Force resistance]], [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Whirlwind|Force whirlwind]], and [[Mind trick/Legends|Mind trick]]. She also learned many techniques from her companions: Atton Rand taught her to shield her thoughts, Brianna taught her [[Precognition/Legends|Battle Precognition]], Mical taught her an advanced form of [[Meditation/Legends|meditation]], and Visas Marr taught her how to [[Force sight|see]] through the Force. She also learned [[Moving Meditation]] while trying to improve the functionality of her utility droid T3-M4. She learned the light-sided Force technique known as [[Force Enlightenment]], after nearly being severed from the Force by the reconvened Jedi Council, and after Kreia, who had revealed herself as the former Darth Traya, stripped away the Masters\\' bond with the Force.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nSurik defeated a number of high-profile adversaries, including Azkul, Vaklu, Atris, and the Sith Lords Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus. She was highly skilled in the art of lightsaber combat, utilizing the lightsaber forms [[Form I/Legends|Shii-Cho]], [[Form II/Legends|Makashi]], and [[Form III/Legends|Soresu]], and was known to have used at least one advanced Force technique, known as [[Force form|Force Channel]]. She was also proficient in many forms of hand-to-hand and melee combat. At the Telosian Jedi Academy, Surik defeated five of the six Handmaiden sisters in hand-to-hand combat. On Dxun, Surik defeated the two champions of the Mandalorians\\' battle circle, Kelborn and [[Bralor]], becoming the champion of the battle circle and earning the champions\\' rights to criticize or praise any Mandalorian who sparred in the battle circle. Mandalore the Preserver told Surik, with respect, that even with all their martial training, battles and ethics, even the greatest of his Mandalorian warriors were no match for her. Even Bralor commented on her abilities stating that he now saw why the Jedi were able to beat them. She also became one of the few Jedi capable of using [[Dun Möch/Legends|Dun Möch]], especially in a duel against [[Darth Sion]] who could not be defeated by normal means. Surik eventually convinced Sion to let go of the Force and to finally allow himself to leave his life of pain and die.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" /> Surik remained the only known light-sided Jedi that used the technique to it\\'s greatest extent (most Jedi that used the technique employed an [[Dun Möch#Inverse Dun Möch|inverse variant]] or in limited applications only).\\n\\n[[File:Fbofdant.jpg|thumb|left|250px|As a veteran of the Mandalorian Wars, Surik was skilled in military tactics and the art of war.]]\\nSurik was also a very skilled tactician. She served during the Mandalorian Wars and had, by war\\'s end, become Revan\\'s most trusted general, and commanded over half of the Republic fleet during the Mandalorian Wars.<ref name=\"Revan\" /> She was known to have taken part in both the second battle of Dxun and of Malachor V, both of which were victorious. She also proved her tactical brilliance, as well as her natural talents of leadership, after her return from exile, during the battle of Khoonda. On Dantooine, a war had broken out between Khoonda and the forces of the mercenary Azkul. Both Khoonda and Azkul wanted Surik on their side, but she decided to help Khoonda. Before the arrival of Azkul\\'s men to the battlefield, Surik bolstered Khoonda\\'s defenses by persuading several civilians to join the Khoonda militia, healing those of the militia who were injured, planting more [[Mine/Legends|mines]] in the surrounding fields, and repairing damaged gun turrets and medical and combat [[Droid/Legends|droids]]. Within a matter of mere hours, she had turned a disorganized mess into a powerful army, able to defeat the larger forces of Azkul.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nSurik was fluent in [[Binary/Legends|droidspeak]], having worked alongside many utility droids during the Mandalorian Wars.<ref>\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', After Surik told T3 to go to the computer terminal and open the hangar bay door so they could escape the Peragus mining facility, Rand asked her how she could understand T3; she replied \"I served with a lot of utility droids in the&hellip; well, many years ago\".</ref> She could also speak and comprehend [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]], [[Mando\\'a/Legends|Mando\\'a]], and [[Tchuukthese]] without the aid of a translator.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> She was also an accomplished [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop racer]], winning sector championships on the Telos Citadel Station, Nar Shaddaa, and Onderon, and was also proficient at playing [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]], a popular card game in which the goal was to reach 20 without going over.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nThe ramifications of Surik\\'s actions were still being felt throughout the galaxy nearly 4,000 years after the defeat of the Sith Triumvirate. The Jedi she trained would go on to resurrect the all-but-decimated Jedi Order. Furthermore, the actions she took on Dantooine, Onderon, and Telos would ensure the solidification of a Republic that, because of the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War, had been teetering on the edge of collapse, prolonging its existence for several thousand more years.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\n==Relationships==\\n====Revan====\\n{{Quote|History remembers her as the Exile.

During the conflict with the Mandalorians, Surik became Revan\\'s most trusted general and ally.<ref name=\"OldRepublic\" /> On her part, Surik came to see Revan as her mentor, and thus she was completely loyal to him. Her feelings for Revan even extended to love, though not in a romantic way. Rather, she loved him like a brother. Surik would later credit Revan\\'s influence as a factor behind her development into a great Jedi.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\nAfter the destruction of the Sith Triumvirate, Surik departed known space with T3-M4 in order to find Revan. She eventually found and freed her mentor from captivity with the help of Lord Scourge. Surik then joined him in an attempt to assassinate the Sith Emperor, who planned to consume all life in the galaxy in order to live indefinitely. Surik, instead of capitalizing on an opportunity to kill the Emperor, chose to save Revan\\'s life during the fight. The assassination plot ultimately failed and Surik was killed by Scourge. While the duel took place, Scourge witnessed a vision of the future through the Force, in which he saw that the Emperor would die by the hand of [[Hero of Tython|a Jedi]]&mdash;but that Jedi was neither Revan or Surik. Hence, he killed Surik in order to feign loyalty to the Emperor.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\nAlthough Surik was dead, she refused to become one with the Force immediately. Instead, she allowed her spirit to stay with Revan, who had been captured and imprisoned once again. For the next three centuries, Surik\\'s spirit augmented Revan\\'s own strength of will, and thus enabled him to resist the Emperor\\'s powers.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\\n\\nAfter three hundred years as the Emperor\\'s prisoner, Revan was released by agents of the Republic and the Jedi Order. Soon after his liberation, Revan was visited by the spirit of Meetra Surik. He then realized that it was her presence that helped him to endure the centuries of captivity.

After she helped him escape and communicated with the utility droid, [[T3-M4]], Rand commented that it must have been tough considering how she could not have a family or husband. After being blackmailed by Kreia at the Telosian Jedi Academy, Rand stuck around Surik during her mission to find the lost Jedi Masters. He even went so far as to ask one of Surik\\'s other companions, Bao-Dur, if he had any chance with Surik. Bao-Dur didn\\'t make a comment at the request and continued his mechanical work on the ship.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nThings got more complicated for Rand when the crew landed on Dantooine. Surik found her prospective Padawan from years before, Mical. Their relationship, though completely friendly, enraged Rand with jealousy, causing him to lash out at Mical whenever he simply offered to help. When the bounty hunter and scout Mira joined the crew of the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\', she first noticed Rand\\'s close attention of Surik and Mical, and came close to figuring out his secret.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" /> After Surik met a pair of Twi\\'leks on Nar Shaddaa who claimed that Rand was not really who he said he was, he eventually confessed to Surik that he was shown the Force by a Jedi with whom he fell in love, but then he killed her for crawling inside his head.<ref name=\"Convo with Atton\" /> With that, Surik trained Rand as a Jedi.<ref name=\"CSWE: Jedi Exile\" />\\n\\n====Mical====\\n{{Quote|He cannot help but love you, in his way.

As a student in the Jedi Order who needed a Master, Mical wanted Surik to be his Master above all else. However, when Surik left to aid the Republic by fighting the Mandalorians, Mical was left without a mentor and thus left the order to work with the Republic as historian and [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]]. While investigating the ruins on Dantooine, ten years after the Mandalorian War, he met Surik again. Though at first he denied knowing her, he confessed that Surik did know him from long ago. Surik regretted causing such a rift in Mical\\'s future and so trained him as Jedi.<ref name=\"KotOR II game\" />\\n\\nWhile traveling with Surik, Mical found himself at odds with the pilot Atton Rand. Both seemingly desired Surik, although Mical\\'s love was more of admiration of her strength and leadership, which was heightened by her beauty.

However, neither Sion nor Surik were willing to back down, and they battled.

The dark-sided Wookiee scout Hanharr joins the player\\'s party instead of Mira. Additionally, Surik kills the Jedi Masters herself upon visiting each planet, rather than having them converge on Dantooine. She instead speaks with Kreia alone at the rebuilt Dantooine Jedi Academy, and Kreia knocks her unconscious and goes to Malachor V. When Surik confronts Atris after Kreia left her, she kills the fallen Jedi Master upon defeating her. After defeating Kreia at the Trayus Core on Malachor V, Kreia\\'s prediction of Surik\\'s companions also change, due to Surik falling to the dark side.<ref name=\"DSV\">\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', Non-canon dark side version of the game.</ref>\\n\\n====Male relationships====\\n=====Visas Marr=====\\n{{Quote|The blinded one shall return to her homeworld, and as she looked upon you, she shall look upon the surface of that world, and perhaps at last see what she was meant to see&hellip; I do know that you must leave her behind.

From the moment Marr sensed Surik across space, she recognized that there was someone in the universe who felt the same spiritual emptiness that she felt, someone who had suffered and lost everything they had ever loved, just as she had. But it wasn\\'t until she had challenged Surik, and was spared, that she came into his service.<ref name=\"NCM storyline\">\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', Non-canon male version of the game.</ref>\\n\\nAfter being shown mercy, she pledged her life to serve him without hesitation, so that she might come to understand how he could go on when he carried so much pain within him. She made it her personal mission to help him and protect him until he would be ready to fight her master, Darth Nihilus. This fervent loyalty came at much to the disapproval of Kreia, and Brianna the Handmaiden. A rivalry for Surik\\'s affections boiled over at one point, when Brianna confronted Marr in her quarters on the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\'. Brianna was suspicious of her Sith nature, and perhaps even a little jealous that Surik had welcomed her into their group without hesitation, and was spending time with her as well. Marr quelled her outrage by confessing that she wished only to serve and protect him, just as Brianna did, and that she could \"see\" from her movements that she was growing to care for him. Marr then hinted at her own feelings when, before Brianna left, she asked her to describe what Surik looked like. With her species lacking eyes and her Force vision somewhat damaged in unexplained ways, she wanted to know more about him.<ref name=\"NCM storyline\" />\\n\\nFor the most part Marr kept these feelings to herself, but when Brianna left the group to take Kreia before Atris, she realized that soon they would be forced to confront her old Master, and she suddenly began to fear losing him. She came to Surik and opened her heart to him, begging him to stay with her and not fight. Surik told her that he couldn\\'t turn away from this battle, but before they arrived at Telos they shared an intimate moment, using their shared Force Vision to \"see\" each other. Eventually Marr was left behind by Surik, as he traveled into the Unknown Regions he could not take anyone he cared for with him. However the love she had felt finally helped her to heal her spirit, and make peace with her past. She vowed that she would always wait for him to return, and that if he would not, she would continue loving him for the rest of her life.<ref name=\"NCM storyline\" />\\n\\n=====Brianna=====\\n{{Quote|I have heard that Jedi sometimes renounce the code by loving another, and fall from the Order.

Before the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' departed from the hidden Jedi enclave on Telos, Jedi Master Atris privately ordered Brianna to sneak aboard the ship, supposedly to assist Surik in finding and uniting the lost Jedi against the hidden Sith threat. When her sisters discover her missing, Atris lied and told them that Brianna had voluntarily left with Surik for reasons that weren\\'t known to her, causing the Handmaidens to believe she had broken her oath. After revealing she had stowed away onboard the ship, Surik accepted her onboard for the journey, much to the annoyance of Kreia and Rand.<ref name=\"NCM storyline\" />\\n\\nThrough talking, sparring, and witnessing many acts of his good nature, Brianna began to question if Atris had been wrong in her judgment of Surik. She sought to understand him, in hopes that she might understand the choices her mother and father had made, and why she had started having doubts about the path she had chosen. After three duels with Surik, Brianna declined to continue their training, explaining that repeated duels had a very significant meaning in Echani culture, and she did not want to break her vow to Atris by allowing their friendship from becoming anything more. This changed however, when Surik told her that because her mother had been the Jedi Master Arren Kae, that she too had the potential to become a Jedi. Faced with this new information, Brianna made the difficult choice of forsaking her oaths like her parents had done before her, and pledged herself to Surik\\'s teachings, becoming a Jedi Guardian. There was no question that this bond made them grow closer, and at times Brianna found herself jealous of Visas Marr, who was also falling for him.<ref name=\"NCM storyline\" />\\n\\nHer feelings towards Surik and her strong passions worked against her in the end; when tricked into believing that Surik had been killed by Kreia, she was tricked into bringing her before Atris to be punished. However Atris had already been corrupted by the dark side, and now seething with jealousy she attacked Brianna, nearly killing her with several attacks of Force Lightning, until Surik arrived and saved her. With her oaths to Atris and her sisters no longer valid, she re-pledged herself to Surik instead, vowing to stay by his side for as long as he would need her. Their alliance would be short lived; when Surik left for the unknown regions he had to leave everyone he cared about behind him, as Revan had done before him. Though it would seem they were destined never to meet again, she would eventually take up the role of Jedi Chronicler and would teach many Padawans about the Jedi who had given up the Force, and became better for it.<ref name=\"NCM storyline\" />\\n\\n=====Atris=====\\n{{Quote|She loved you, you know, as one loves a champion.

It seemed that having someone she cared about turn away from the path of the Jedi shook her deeply, and contributed to her fall to the dark side.

The galaxy\\'s luminous disk contained some four hundred billion [[Star/Legends|stars]], of which around a quarter had been properly surveyed by the [[galactic community]] by the time of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. The luminous disk revolved around the [[Galactic Center]], a [[Black hole/Legends|supermassive black hole]] that massed as much as four million suns.

Companion Besh, also known as [[Firefist]], was some 150,000 light-years away from the galaxy and had only ever been surveyed by probots.

Also known as the Architects, this spectacularly powerful race was believed to have been capable of manipulating and moving the very stars: surviving Celestial machinery like [[Centerpoint Station]] and the [[Cosmic Turbine]] could manipulate gravity on a titanic scale with [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsor]] pulses, [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beams]], and [[hyperspace wormhole]]s. With this technology, the Celestials were believed to have been responsible for building the [[Corellian system]], the [[Vultar system]], and 15 other star systems, as well as the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]], the [[Kathol Rift/Legends|Kathol Rift]], and [[the Maw]] black hole cluster.<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"Author\\'s Cut\" /> Pre-Republic specialists believed the Celestials to also be responsible for the [[circumferential hyperspace barrier]], possibly as a defense against outside interference. They were also believed to be responsible for the [[Western barrier|chain]] of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] anomalies west of the Core that bisected the galaxy and prevented travel into the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Speculation holds that the Celestials had crafted the hyperspace anomalies that bisected the galaxy in order to contain the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]].<ref name=\"Author\\'s Cut\" />\\n\\nA number of other spacefaring races around this time became clients of the Celestials. The insectile [[Killik/Legends|Killiks]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] were exploited as laborers and were seeded across the galaxy, until around [[30,000 BBY]] when they [[Great Migration|disappeared]] into the west of the galaxy and into the Unknown Regions, presumably relocated by the Celestials. The [[Kwa]] and the [[Gree/Legends|Gree]] made use of structures known as the [[Infinity Gate]]s and [[hypergate]]s, respectively, to travel between planets and came into territorial conflict with each other. Other species fled to escape the Celestials: the [[Sharu/Legends|Sharu]] of the [[Rafa system/Legends|Rafa system]] far in the galactic east had a brief period of expansion, spreading their iconic plastic [[pyramid]] cities as far into the Core as [[Aargau/Legends|Aargau]], but this may have attracted the attention of the Celestials and the Sharu buried their cities and sought refuge in primitivism to escape them. Likewise, the [[Columi/Legends|Columi]] of [[Columus/Legends|Columus]] made surveys of both the Humans and the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] in the Core and were unimpressed by what they found, but also fled back to their homeworld, perhaps to avoid retribution from the Celestials.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nAround [[35,000 BBY]], the domain of the Celestials was usurped when the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] slave race revolted. Stealing technology from the [[Kwa]], they waged war against the other servant races,<ref name=\"EGW\">\\'\\'[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]\\'\\'</ref> and broke through the barrier surrounding the Unknown Regions into the galaxy proper and waged a [[Celestial-Rakata War|war of extermination]] upon the Celestials.

The Infinite Empire occupied a scattering of systems across the galaxy, but vast tracts of territory between these holdings remained untouched, allowing smaller interstellar confederations to flourish. The [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronians]] and the [[Gossam/Legends|Gossam]] experimented with the [[tumble hyperdrive]], and while worlds like [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] and [[Duro/Legends|Duro]] were occupied by the Rakata, [[Human/Legends|Humans]], [[Duros/Legends|Duros]], [[Selonian/Legends|Selonians]] and [[Drall (planet)|Drall]] were able to study the principles of the [[Force-drive|Rakatan hyperdrive]]. The Rakata proved to be cruel masters, consigning entire subject populations to [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]]. After nearly five thousand years of dominance, the Rakatan Empire collapsed after a devastating plague swept through the Empire that stripped the Rakata of their ability to use the Force.

Developing technological replacements to its Force-based components, various species struck out from their homeworlds, first with slower-than-light [[Sleeper ship/Legends|sleeper ship]] colonies, followed by the development of the [[hyperspace cannon]]. Through this re-use of Rakatan castoffs, a number of civilizations asserted themselves: the Humans and Duros dominated the Core, while the cetacean [[Herglic/Legends|Herglics]] built up their own [[Herglic Trade Empire|trade empire]] to the south. On the Rim, Human sleeper ship colonies formed the [[Tionese (people)|Tionese civilization]], which was united into an [[Xim\\'s empire|empire]] by [[Xim/Legends|Xim the Despot]], before coming into [[Xim Wars|conflict]] with the [[Hutt Empire|empire]] of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\\n\\nThis period coincided with the beginning of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] on [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] with its studies of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], as well as the religious rivalry between understandings of the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]] and [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark sides of the Force]]. [[Great Schism/Legends|Conflict]] between the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] would assert itself several times throughout galactic history, a cycle that continued beyond the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n[[File:GalacticExplorations.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A map of the progress of the exploration of the galaxy.]]\\nIn [[25,000 BBY/Legends|25,000 BBY]], in the aftermath of the [[Unification Wars (Galactic Republic)|Unification Wars]], the various states of the Core assembled on Coruscant and signed the [[Galactic Constitution/Legends|Galactic Constitution]], establishing a civilization under a common law, language and currency, proclaiming the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. The Republic united the largely-Human [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], and the [[Core Founder/Legends|Core Founders]] included political players like Coruscant, [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]], [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]] and [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], military strongholds like the [[Azure Imperium]] of [[Axum]] and [[Anaxes/Legends|Anaxes]], as well as [[Esseles/Legends|Esseles]] and [[Rendili/Legends|Rendili]], emerging commercial hubs like [[Tepasi/Legends|Tepasi]], [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] and [[Humbarine/Legends|Humbarine]], and worlds important to the medical, diplomatic and philosophical arts, like [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], [[Caamas/Legends|Caamas]], [[Rhinnal/Legends|Rhinnal]] and [[Shawken]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Expansionist Era]] coincided with the foundation of the Republic and saw the beginnings of the official charting and settlement of much of the galaxy\\'s spiral. Scouts pushing east from Coruscant moved up two trade routes, the [[Perlemian Trade Route/Legends|Perlemian Trade Route]] and the [[Corellian Run/Legends|Corellian Run]], which formed the boundaries of a vast wedge of space known as \"[[The Slice/Legends|the Slice]]\". At the end of the Corellian Run lay [[Kalarba/Legends|Kalarba]], a trade hub maintained by the merchants of [[Paqwepori]], while the Perlemian led to the trade worlds of [[Tirahnn/Legends|Tirahnn]], [[Nouane/Legends|Nouane]], and [[Roche asteroid field|Roche]].<ref name=\"EGW\" /> No similar corridors were found to the galactic west, which resulted in much of that quadrant of the galaxy remaining unexplored and mysterious, becoming known as the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. This expansion saw the Republic come into [[Tionese War|conflict]] with the Human civilizations of the [[Tion Cluster/Legends|Tion Cluster]]. After its victory in [[24,000 BBY]], the Republic swelled with more territory than it could initially govern as many systems clamored for protection against the depredations of the Hutts.<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\\n[[File:Alsakan_Conflicts_map.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The galaxy from the [[Indecta Era]] to the [[Kymoodon Era]].]]\\nThe [[Great Manifest Period/Legends|Great Manifest Period]] began in [[20,000 BBY]] with the widespread settling of the Slice, with the dense web of systems at its tip becoming known as the [[Arrowhead]]. This region became heavily-dominated by Coruscant while [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] dominated settlement around the Corellian Run. Rivalry between Coruscant and [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]] over policy on the Perlemian sparked the [[First Alsakan Conflict]] in [[17,000 BBY]], the start of the [[Indecta Era]], and though peace would be brokered between the two, the [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|Alsakan Conflicts]] would continue in an abbreviated form for some 14,000 years. The first five Alsakan Conflicts also discouraged settlement along the Perlemian, pushing colonists to the [[Corellian Hegemony]] in the [[Trailing Sectors/Legends|Trailing Sectors]] along the Corellian Run and the growing [[Corellian Trade Spine/Legends|Corellian Trade Spine]].<ref name=\"EGW\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\\n\\nThe [[Kymoodon Era]], opening in [[15,000 BBY/Legends|15,000 BBY]], ushered another colonization boom on par with the Great Manifest Period. Improvements in the hyperdrive allowed many odd pockets of colonization to spring up in the unexplored northern and southern quadrants, and the Herglics joined the Republic, beginning a surge in development around the [[Hidakai Pool]], which would become the [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]]. However, the era stored up the seeds for future conflict, as the Republic\\'s borders increasingly abutted those of [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]], leaving isolated colonies open to raids by Hutt [[Slaver/Legends|slavers]]. Widespread resentment of the Hutts on the Rim was tapped by [[Contispex I/Legends|Contispex I]] and the [[Humanocentrism|Humanocentric]] [[Pius Dea]] religious sect to begin a series of [[Pius Dea Crusades|Crusades]] against the Hutts in [[12,000 BBY/Legends|12,000 BBY]]. The millennia-long [[Pius Dea Era]] would see many non-Human species conquered, persecuted, or exterminated until the [[Contispex dynasty]] was [[Seventh Alsakan Conflict|overthrown]] by the Jedi Order, and would foment extreme resentment among the species of the Rim. The subsequent [[Ductavis Era]] and [[Rianitus Period]] from [[11,000 BBY|11,000]]-[[8000 BBY]] would be periods of retrenchment and rebuilding following the Crusades.<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\\n[[File:Pius_Dea_Crusades.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The galaxy during the [[Pius Dea Era]].]]\\nThe [[Subterra Period]] of 8000-[[7000 BBY]] saw new mapping of the galactic southern quadrant, with colonies such as [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]] serving as anchors for the tangles of [[praedium]]s that linked the region. Scouts also penetrated the [[Rishi Maze/Legends|Rishi Maze]] around this time. However, the lack of a [[Super-hyperroute/Legends|super-hyperroute]] into the southern quadrant and the new colonies\\' general inaccessibility promoted lawlessness in the Rim and limited Coruscant\\'s authority, which was believed to have contributed to the [[Second Great Schism]] of the Jedi Order in [[7003 BBY]], beginning a galaxy-wide uprising of [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] known as the [[Hundred-Year Darkness/Legends|Hundred-Year Darkness]]. In the war\\'s aftermath, the defeated Dark Jedi were exiled beyond the Rim into the unexplored space north of the Perlemian. There, the [[Exiles]] settled the worlds of [[Korriban]] and [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]] within the [[Stygian Caldera]], where they dominated the native [[Sith (species)/Legends|Sith]] and established an [[Sith Empire/Legends|empire]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\\n\\nDuring the [[Manderon Period]], the [[Corellian Trade Spine/Legends|Corellian Trade Spine]] and the [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]] were established in [[5500 BBY/Legends|5500 BBY]] after the Herglics, [[Givin/Legends|Givin]] and [[Corellian/Legends|Corellians]] linked together hundreds of pre-existing praediums, improving access to the southern quadrant. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], the Sith Empire was rediscovered by the Republic, beginning the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]] when the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]] attempted to conquer the Republic. The [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] were defeated and once again driven into exile, but it was the beginning of a threat that would trouble the Republic for the remainder of its existence. A thousand years later in [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], Sith teachings discovered on Korriban and [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] enticed the Jedi [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] and [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] to the dark side, beginning the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. The Sith\\'s alliance with the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]], a group of warrior-nomads descended from the [[Taung/Legends|Taungs]], in that war would prove to be the genesis of another threat to the Republic with the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. The Republic endured nearly fifty years of almost continuous fighting known as the [[Old Sith Wars]] as a result of Exar Kun until the [[Darth Revan\\'s Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] was destroyed in [[3950 BBY]] by the redeemed Sith Lord [[Revan/Legends|Revan]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\\n[[File:New_Sith_Wars_map.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The galaxy during the final years of the [[Draggulch Period]].]]\\nBy [[3700 BBY/Legends|3700 BBY]], the galaxy had been charted and settled as far as [[Farana/Legends|Farana]] in the north and Malastare in the south, but much of the northern and southern quadrants beyond the trade routes remained unsettled. At that time, however, the Brentaal-born explorer [[Freia Kallea/Legends|Freia Kallea]] extended the ancient [[Brentaal–Denon Route]] and linked several pre-exisiting praediums. By [[3693 BBY]], she had expanded the trade routes south of [[Denon/Legends|Denon]] as far as [[Imynusoph/Legends|Imynusoph]], mapping the full length of the [[Hydian Way/Legends|Hydian Way]], the only super-hyperroute to span the length of the galaxy. The ease with which vessels could now reach the northern and southern quadrants greatly expanded the Republic\\'s footprint into the [[New Territories/Legends|New Territories]] and the [[Western Reaches/Legends|Western Reaches]] and opened up countless new sources of minerals, crystals and gases.<ref name=\"TEA\" /> From [[3681 BBY|3681]]-[[3642 BBY]], however, the Republic endured decades of [[Great Galactic War|war]] and [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|tension]] with a [[Sith Empire (Post–Great Hyperspace War)|resurgent Sith Empire]] formed by exiles from the Great Hyperspace War, led by the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor Vitiate]].

In the ensuing millennium of fighting between the Republic and the [[New Sith]], the Republic almost collapsed, culminating in the [[Republic Dark Age]] in the [[1100 BBY|final century]], when the Republic\\'s authority effectively ceased to exist beyond the major trade routes and the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] communications network ceased to function.

This dissatisfaction was stoked into a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist movement]] by the Sith, which had spent a millennium in hiding. Orchestrating the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the [[Order of the Sith Lords]] managed to [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|destroy the Jedi Order]] and [[Declaration of a New Order|restore]] their Empire under [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]]. Sidious dissolved the Republic and replaced it with the short-lived [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], and eventually [[Dissolution of the Imperial Senate/Legends|dissolved the Republic\\'s trappings completely]]. A legacy of Imperial rule was the opening and widespread settlement of the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], as well as the charting and exploration of much of the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. The Empire lasted for two decades of tyranny, but after the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] and the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|death]] of Darth Sidious at the hands of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] was [[Declaration of a New Republic/Legends|established]] from an [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|alliance]] of [[Alliance of Free Planets|free worlds]].

Another outcome of the war was a normalisation of relations between the galaxy proper and the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]], the dominant power of the Unknown Regions. Within a few decades, stable hyperroutes and colonies had been established into the region and had removed much of its mystery.<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\\n\\nSome of the Yuuzhan Vong were incorporated in the [[galactic community]], but the post-Yuuzhan Vong War galaxy proved incredibly difficult to govern, resulting in a [[Second Galactic Civil War]] between the Galactic Alliance and a [[Confederation]] led by Corellia. Within a century, the Galactic Empire had been [[Fel Empire|restored]] under the [[Fel dynasty]], although this time without Sith backing. Ultimately, however, the [[Fel Empire]] was manipulated by the [[One Sith]], led by [[Darth Krayt]], to [[Sith–Imperial War|declare war]] upon the Galactic Alliance after the Sith exploited lingering hatred of the Yuuzhan Vong to to make it appear that they were planning to re-conquer the galaxy. The One Sith usurped the Imperial throne shortly afterwards, forming a [[Darth Krayt\\'s Galactic Empire|new Sith empire]], but the [[Second Imperial Civil War|resulting war]] between the Sith and the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]] and the Fel-loyalist [[Empire-in-exile]] resulted in the [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|Sith\\'s defeat]]. Thereafter, the Galactic Alliance became the dominant government in the galaxy [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate|once again]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" /><ref name=\"Legacy\" />\\n\\n==Political geography==\\n[[File:GalaxyMap_JediArchives.png|thumb|right|250px|A map of the galaxy as seen in the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]].]]\\n===Star systems===\\nThe known galaxy included nearly a billion inhabited [[Star system/Legends|star systems]], from uncharted [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]]\\' settlements to planet-spanning [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopoleis]] where scarcely a meter of ground remained untouched. Under the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], nearly seventy million of those system were sufficiently populated to merit some form of representation.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nIn the first years of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], any [[Planet/Legends|planet]] with a large enough population was granted a seat in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. However, even before the Galactic Republic had expanded beyond the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], this system of government was unworkable: the Senate\\'s sheer size made debate interminable and consensus almost impossible to arrive to. The Planetary Senate was thus reorganized, with sectors being formed of groups of up to fifty star systems to act as the new constituencies, while recognized [[Associate Planetary Representative|representatives]] of a single planet or species still had the right to petition the full Senate. A prominent example of this towards the end of the Republic was [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]], representing the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] people of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"Ep2\">{{Film|II}}</ref>\\n\\n[[Planetary Governor/Legends|Planetary Governors]] represented the central government on a single [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Their writ typically included the entire star system, though there were exceptions for systems that included multiple planets with huge populations or very different cultures, such as the [[Corellian system]]. In the eldest parts of the Core Worlds, systems and even individual planets were centers of political power, a relic of the Galactic Republic\\'s origins. Elsewhere, systems were subservient in representation to subsectors, sectors and regions.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n===Sectors===\\n[[File:ArkanisSector.jpg||thumb|left|150px|The [[Arkanis sector/Legends|Arkanis sector]], a post-Ruusan Reformations sector of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]].]]\\nThe basic political unit for much of galactic history was the [[Sector/Legends|sector]], largely artificial divisions of space organized for political, military and economic reasons. After the first years of the Galactic Republic, the star systems of the Republic were organized into sectors limited to fifty systems with substantial populations. As the Republic expanded, the huge number of sectors led to gridlock within the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], and some sectors swelled to include thousands of inhabited worlds, even as galactic civilization continued to expand wildly, until there were millions of sectors.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThis was not resolved until the [[Ruusan Reformation]]s of [[1000 BBY]], which reorganized the galaxy into 1,024 regional sectors divided into constituent subsectors. The [[Chommell sector/Legends|Chommell sector]] of the [[Mid Rim]], for example, though fairly sparsely settled, contained some forty thousand inhabited worlds. Sectors by [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] included cultural groupings like the [[Tapani sector/Legends|Tapani sector]] and the [[Senex-Juvex/Legends|Senex-Juvex]], and business-controlled economic areas like the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], but generally they were fairly arbitrary groupings of planets and colonies of very differing fates and cultures, such as the [[Gordian Reach/Legends|Gordian Reach]], the [[Arkanis sector/Legends|Arkanis sector]], and the [[Anoat sector/Legends|Anoat sector]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe Ruusan Reformations created a number of problems with sectorial representation that would not be resolved until the Republic\\'s end. A moratorium was included on the creation of new sectors, but settlers kept pushing beyond the Republic\\'s frontier, reclaiming systems lost during the [[New Sith Wars]] and settling new worlds. Some of these systems were annexed by existing sectors, which caused some outlying sectors to swell to gargantuan proportions. Others became \\'\\'de facto\\'\\' corporate possessions, or were directly administered by the Republic bureaucracy and denied Senate representation, though it was claimed that they were \"virtually represented\" by other senators. The old Core sectors saw the rimward megasectors as a threat to their ancient power and prestige, while the directly-administered systems complained that their \"virtual representation\" was a farce. The reforms of [[124 BBY]] sought to address these issues, with many settled areas outside the Republic\\'s borders becoming incorporated as [[Freestanding subsectors/Legends|freestanding subsectors]], with their representatives reporting to the senator of an associated sector.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nUntil the final years of the Galactic Republic, sectors were governed by their [[Senator/Legends|senators]], while the [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] had the right to appoint a [[Governor-General/Legends|Governor-General]] to coordinate military action within the sector during a state of emergency. [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] exploited this law frequently during the Clone Wars, culminating in the [[Sector Governance Decree/Legends|Sector Governance Decree]], that appointed a permanent new class of military governors to the regional sectors - the Galactic Empire\\'s [[Moff/Legends|Moffs]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /> The Galactic Empire also created or carved out a number of new sectors, overturning the Ruusan Reformations\\' moratorium, including the [[Indrexu sector]] in the [[Greater Tion]], and combined several freestanding subsectors to create the [[Baxel sector/Legends|Baxel]] and [[Zuma sector]]s.<ref name=\"EAOC\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-atlas-online-companion|text=\\'\\'Star Wars: The Essential Atlas\\'\\' Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}}</ref>\\n\\n===Regions===\\n{{Quote|I\\'ve flown from one end of this galaxy to the other, and I\\'ve seen a lot of strange stuff.|[[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\\n[[File:NJO_galaxy_map.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stylized map of the galaxy, showing the various regions.]]\\nThe galaxy\\'s largest territorial entities were the regions.

The nine most famous regions were the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], the [[Colonies/Legends|Colonies]], the [[Inner Rim]], the [[Expansion Region/Legends|Expansion Region]], the [[Mid Rim]], the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], and beyond the galactic frontier, [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] and the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Casual phraseology usually split the galaxy into \"the Core\" and \"the Rim\", with the latter consisting of the Expansion Region and parts beyond.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n====Deep Core====\\nAt the very heart of the galaxy, the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] (also known as the Core Systems) was a region that spanned seven thousand [[Light-year/Legends|light-years]], and contained roughly 30 billion stars.<ref name=\"TEA\" /> Due to the gravitational pull of the vast number of stars, as well as a massive [[Black hole/Legends|black hole]] at [[Galactic Center|the center]], local space-time was severely warped, making hyperspace travel difficult at best. For millennia, only the fringes of the Deep Core closest to the Core Worlds, within a mathematically defined boundary known as the [[Horizon]], had been settled. These worlds included [[Khomm/Legends|Khomm]], [[Thoadeye system|Thoadeye]], [[Vulpter/Legends|Vulpter]], and the dominant planet of the Deep Core, [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]]. The heart of the region was thought to be almost inaccessible until [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] found several safe [[hyperlane]]s into the region. The area remained fiercely loyal to the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], and was an Imperial stronghold until almost twenty years after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n====Core Worlds====\\nThe [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] was an ancient region bordering the outlying areas of the Deep Core, and included some of the most prestigious, well-developed, well-known, and heavily populated planets in the galaxy. The Galactic Republic and subsequently all galaxywide governments were born in the Core Worlds and spread out over the galaxy. During both the time of the Republic and Empire, Coruscant, a major core world, was the Galactic [[Capital/Legends|Capital]]. The region of the Core Worlds known as the [[Tetrahedron]] became the cradle of the early Republic, and simultaneously scouts discovered the Perlemian Trade Route and the Corellian Run emanating from Coruscant, creating a region known as the [[Arrowhead]] containing the ancient worlds of [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]], [[Anaxes/Legends|Anaxes]], [[Basilisk]] and [[Ixtlar/Legends|Ixtlar]]. Colonization created a semi-circular ring extending south as far as [[Abregado-rae/Legends|Abregado-rae]], often considered the cream of the Core Worlds, while subsequent centuries create a second ring to the galactic west, though these worlds, disparaged as \"[[the Negs]]\" for their negative-digit [[Galactic coordinates/Legends|galactic coordinates]], were looked down upon by the rest of the Core. The Core\\'s natural wealth was buoyed by the farming worlds of the [[Agricultural Circuit]], the semi-independent colonies of the [[Illodia sector]], the [[Bormea/Darpa Corridor]], the manufacturing planets of the [[Humbarine sector/Legends|Humbarine sector]], and the military [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyards]] of the [[Kuat sector/Legends|Kuat sector]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n====Colonies====\\nThe [[Colonies/Legends|Colonies]], so named because it was among the first areas outside the Core to be colonized, contained many of the galaxy\\'s wealthiest worlds and prided itself on being the galaxy\\'s economic engine. Worlds here were typically heavily populated, industrialized, and cultured, and the region was considered the meeting point of Core wealth and Rim raw materials. The Colonies, forming the tip of [[The Slice/Legends|the Slice]], came to include many of the galaxy\\'s oldest manufacturing worlds, including [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]], [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]] and [[Neimoidia/Legends|Neimoidia]]. Subsequent colonization produced the shipyards of [[Loronar/Legends|Loronar]], the urbanized worlds of the [[Pencael system]], and the young worlds of [[Yabol Opa/Legends|Yabol Opa]] with its great university, the [[fortress world]] of [[Raithal]], and the farm worlds of the [[Delle system]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n[[File:JKA_galaxy.png|thumb|left|250px|A schematic view of the galaxy.]]\\n\\n====Inner Rim====\\nThe [[Inner Rim]] was a region of the galaxy between the Colonies and the [[Expansion Region/Legends|Expansion Region]]. It was originally just called \"The Rim\", as it was expected to be the farthest extent of the known galaxy for [[Standard century/Legends|centuries]], but the Expanded Rim (later renamed the Expansion Region) was opened within a hundred years of the Inner Rim being settled during the [[Great Manifest Period/Legends|Great Manifest Period]]. Inner Rimmers tended to see themselves as being part of the Core and looked disdainfully upon the \"outer galaxy\", but were known to resent and envy the greater wealth and history of the Core Worlds. The region had minimal cultural influence and had few truly notable planets beyond the ecumenopolis of [[Denon/Legends|Denon]] and the medical worlds of [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]] and [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]]. As the bridge between the Core and the Rim, the Inner Rim held great strategic value, and during both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War, brutal battles were fought over the region.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n====Expansion Region====\\nThe [[Expansion Region/Legends|Expansion Region]] began as an experiment in corporate-controlled worlds, known as the [[Exploitation Region]], with powerful corporations exploiting and profiting heavily from the planets for their raw materials, metals and [[Ore/Legends|ores]]. Inhabitants were oppressed while the corporations stripped entire stellar systems along the Corellian Run of all their resources. The damage was so catastrophic that colonization shifted spinward to the Perlemian Trade Route, which was responsible for the conspicuous northern \"bulge\" of the modern Inner Rim\\'s border. Colonization resumed during the Great Manifest Period, but the [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|Alsakan Conflicts]] destroyed many of the Expansion Region\\'s worlds in [[The Slice/Legends|the Slice]], shifting colonization west of the Corellian Run, creating a stretch of space known as the [[77 Sectors]] that was dominated by Corellians for millennia. This part of the Expansion Region thrived, with the Rimma, Hydia, and Corellian Trade Spine Routes opening up the region and linking worlds like [[Tynna/Legends|Tynna]], the [[Gran/Legends|Gran]] homeworld of [[Kinyen/Legends|Kinyen]], and trading planets of the [[Harrin Trade Corridor]]. This region\\'s citizens often preferred to think of themselves as being apart from the rest of the luckless Expansion Region, which continued to suffer during the Republic\\'s final millennium. A second, disastrous experiment in corporate control known as the [[Outer Expansion Zone/Legends|Outer Expansion Zone]] ravaged the region and the [[Outer Expansion Zone scandal|resulting scandal]] forced the Senate to disband the [[Expansionist Oligarchy/Legends|Expansionist Oligarchy]], but the final centuries of the Republic saw the Slice sectors of the Region fall into economic ruin. The story was told by the region\\'s trade routes: while the Core, Colonies and Inner Rim were dense webs of tangled [[hyperlane]]s, the Expansion Region was ill-served by routes and the casual observer might think that it had never been settled. Expansion Region worlds continued to be producers of raw materials and ores. However, most natural resources were exhausted by the [[Imperial Period]], with [[Gyndine/Legends|Gyndine]], [[Bacrana/Legends|Bacrana]] and [[Cyrillia/Legends|Cyrillia]] being among the few remaining viable ports.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n====Mid Rim====\\nWith fewer natural resources (and therefore a smaller population) than many neighboring regions, the [[Mid Rim]] was a territory where residents worked hard for everything they had. Colonization began as the Expansion Region was settled, and while corporations continued to prefer to exploit that region, homesteading incentives and development grants from Coruscant were instead picked up by religious communes or local political confederations. The Slice in the Mid Rim was colonized slowly over several millennia, following a crosshatching pattern determined by Coruscant, giving rise to an orderly region whose residents had plenty of room to spread out. Corporate exploitation remained in the Expansion Region while lawlessness gravitated to the less-governed [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], which were opened for colonization at the same time. Consequently, the Mid Rim built up a successful economy based on low-cost manufacturing and agriculture, and following the blazing of the Hydian War in [[3693 BBY]], the northern and southern arcs of the Mid Rim came into shape. Historic Republic outposts like [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]] or lost colonies like [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] found themselves at the heart of new, orderly, government zoned settlement districts, some of which retained their alphanumeric identifications for centuries. Few of the Mid Rim\\'s worlds became famous, but among those that did were the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] homeworld of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] and the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] homeworld of [[Iridonia/Legends|Iridonia]], the ocean planet of [[Glee Anselm/Legends|Glee Anselm]], the [[Order of the Sacred Circle]]\\'s retreat of [[Monastery/Legends|Monastery]], and [[Ansion/Legends|Ansion]], the nexus of several hyperlanes linked by the [[Keitumite Mutual Military Treaty]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n====Outer Rim Territories====\\nThe [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] was the largest region of the galaxy, and the last widely settled expanse before [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] and the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. It was strewn with obscure worlds, and rugged, primitive frontier planets. Due to its distance from the Core, government control was historically the weakest in the Outer Rim Territories, and it was the traditional refuge for dissidents, pilgrims and freedom-seekers, but it was also beset by lawlessness, oppression and violence. The worlds of the Outer Rim were immensely varied as a consequence: [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]] was a prosperous, industrialised megalopolis, and [[Entralla/Legends|Entralla]] was a vibrant, [[Human High Culture|Human-dominated]] spaceport world, but [[Terminus/Legends|Terminus]] and [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]] were criminal-run [[Shadowport/Legends|shadowports]], and [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] was a Hutt-controlled trade depot. The Outer Rim was also dotted with barely-habited worlds like [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]], [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], [[Tund/Legends|Tund]] and [[Muskree]]. Worlds closest to the major [[Super-hyperroute/Legends|super-hyperroutes]] tended to be the most civilized, but far from these trade links, they tended to be dominated by the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]]. Mass settlement of large portions of the Outer Rim did not begin until after [[5500 BBY/Legends|5500 BBY]], when colonists took advantage of the new trade routes of the Hydian, the Rimma, and the Corellian Trade Spine. Settlement in the southern quadrant was rapid, but expansion in the northern quadrant was hampered by the [[Great Galactic War]] and the horrors of the [[Kanz Disorders/Legends|Kanz Disorders]]. In a reversal of the galaxy\\'s usual pattern, colonization was slowest in the Slice, dominated as it was [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]]. Republic authority in the region all-but collapsed during the [[New Sith Wars]], and arguably never returned, with the Hutts filling the power vacuum and piracy, slavery and anarchy dominating. In [[124 BBY]], the Senate declared the whole region a [[Free Trade Zone/Legends|Free Trade Zone]] in an effort to jump-start economic development, but this was exploited by the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]], and the Senate re-imposing taxation in [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]] was the trigger for the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]] and the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]]. The Galactic Empire oppressed much of the Outer Rim, leading to greater sympathy for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] in the region, but the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance both failed to impose central control in the area, leaving the Outer Rim much as it had been for centuries.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n===[[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] and the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]===\\n[[File:Wildspace1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|By [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] often referred to the southeast of the galactic disk.]]\\n[[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] was the frontier of galactic society, separating the known parts of the galaxy from the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. It was not a formal label, but was applied to the unsettled galactic fringe and other parts of the galaxy with negligible colonization or development. Wild Space by the Imperial Period typically referred to the wispy fringe of the galaxy\\'s eastern disk, as well as the narrow, meandering strip that separated the civilized galaxy from the Unknown Regions. One of Emperor Palpatine\\'s last acts was to open up much of the region to more extensive exploration. Wild Space differed from the Unknown Regions in that some of Wild Space had been explored, though not extensively, and the findings recorded in official logs; the Unknown Regions remained mysterious. The worlds of Wild Space largely ignored the central government, and were generally peaceful, but many acted as criminal hideaways.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n[[File:FateOutboundFlight-TEA.png|thumb|right|250px|Part of the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]], and [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] separating it from the rest of the galaxy, in [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]], showing the territory of the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]] and the planned route of the \\'\\'[[Outbound Flight]]\\'\\' .]]\\nThe term \"[[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]\" referred to those areas that had not been directly surveyed by Republic or Imperial scouts. It was most commonly applied to the less-known parts of the galaxy\\'s western disk, a quadrant stretching roughly between [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]] and the [[Imperial Remnant]]. However, the term also applied to the galaxy\\'s halo of gas, dust and stars, as well as the satellite galaxies. When the aggregate of all this territory is summed, the Unknown Regions reached nearly triple the size of settled space, but by some calculations, just 15% of the galactic disk\\'s total stellar mass qualified as part of the Unknown Regions. The chunk of the Unknown Regions within the galaxy was a product of the lack of any western analogues to the Perlemian Trade Route and the Corellian Run, and the Republic\\'s early scouts were content to expand into the easier-to-reach territories of [[The Slice/Legends|the Slice]]. It later became clear that the route to the west was in fact barred by a [[Western barrier|tangle]] of hyperspace disturbances that effectively split the galaxy in half, forming the midline of the [[Circumferential hyperspace barrier|galactic barrier]] that enveloped the galaxy. The barrier to the Unknown Regions was permeable, however, with [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] tales telling of strange ships visiting distant Outer Rim ports like Terminus, hyperdrive mishaps taking ships through the divide, or ancient alien trails allowing access to the region.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe ill-fated [[Outbound Flight Project]] was one of the first official attempts to penetrate the Unknown Regions, while the Galactic Empire\\'s [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth\\'raw\\'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] spent several years mapping portions of the area. The [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] were the dominant species of the Unknown Regions, but in comparison to known space, where most amoral or expansionist species were cowed or exterminated by the early Republic, the Unknown Regions were still a savage, anarchic area. Other powerful species within the region included the [[Vagaari Empire|slaver empire]] of the [[Vagaari/Legends|Vagaari]], the illusion-spinning mollusks called [[Croke]]s, the religiously-fanatical [[Ssi-ruu]]k, and the [[blind berserker]]s of the [[Leech Legion]]. Outside the disk, in the satellite galaxy of [[Firefist|Companion Besh]], lived the [[Nagai]] and their oppressors, the [[Tof]]s. The Nagai invaded known space in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], pursued by the Tofs, and joined forces with the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] to defeat their oppressors and returned to Firefist to liberate it.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nNormalization of relations with the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]] after the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]] led to the establishment of stable hyperroutes into the Unknown Regions through the [[Utegetu Nebula/Legends|Utegetu Nebula]], such as the [[Rago Run]], and by [[44 ABY]] the name was largely inaccurate, at least when applied to the galactic disk. The galactic halo and the satellite galaxies, however, remained poorly explored and mysterious.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n===Miscellaneous territories===\\n[[File:Miscellaneous_regions.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the galaxy\\'s main regions, miscellaneous smaller territories, and client states and [[Allied Region]]s.]]\\nThe galaxy\\'s ten main regions did not reflect the full reality of its political and cultural divisions. Within the territorial bands between the Core and the Outer Rim lay a number of groupings and prefectures, some that had their own regional governments, and others that had only shared cultural stereotypes. The largest of these was [[The Slice/Legends|the Slice]], a vast region of space between the Perlemian and the Corellian Run generally considered the center of galactic civilization and commerce. At its tip was the [[Arrowhead]], encompassing the Core Worlds part of the Slice, with Coruscant at its point. The Arrowhead\\'s other two vertices traditionally fell on [[Vento system|Vento]] on the Perlemian and on Corellia itself, on the Run. The Arrowhead contained the elite of the Core Worlds, and grew out of the ancient [[Pre-Republic era|pre-Republic]] [[Tetrahedron]] that was the cradle of galactic civilization. Sometimes called the Inner Core, the Arrowhead included [[Ixtlar/Legends|Ixtlar]], [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]], [[Grizmallt/Legends|Grizmallt]] and [[Anaxes/Legends|Anaxes]], which became ever-more prestigious the closer they were to Coruscant.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nColonists out of the Arrowhead settled the Slice, going out into what became known as the Colonies, and then further beyond. The worlds along the Perlemian and the Corellian Run were settled for millennia, and colonization slowly reached out from both to knit the Slice together. The Core, Colonies and Inner Rim portions of the Slice were thickly-settled and crisscrossed with thousands of hyperlanes and [[praedium]]s; the Expansion Region was heavily-colonized near the Corellian Run (and dominated by Corellian interests), but more sparsely settled south of the Perlemian, the product of the millennia-long [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|Alsakan Conflicts]]. The Slice\\'s luster had begun to fade by the time colonists pushed beyond the Expansion Region in the central Slice; the Mid Rim reaches were well-surveyed but thinly-settled, and the Hutts dominated the Outer Rim precincts even beyond Hutt Space. Though new industries and businesses had largely moved beyond the Slice by the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the region was still considered the heart of galactic civilization, a distinction its citizens remained proud of.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Southern Core]] was settled from the Arrowhead and grew through contact with a number of advanced ancient civilizations, including the [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronians]], the [[Herglic/Legends|Herglics]], and the [[Atrisian Commonwealth]]. This made it a polyglot region that resisted easy characterization. The western quadrant of the Core Worlds long resisted exploration, lacking any [[Super-hyperroute/Legends|super-hyperroutes]] and limiting progress along hyperlanes like the [[Metellos Trade Route/Legends|Metellos Trade Route]] to one- or two-light-year hops. Worlds settled along this western frontier received a negative first digit in their [[Galactic coordinates/Legends|galactic coordinates]] owing to their position west of Coruscant, earning them the name \"[[the Negs]]\", dooming such areas as the [[Farlax sector]] to perennial second-class status within the Core.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Northern Dependencies/Legends|Northern Dependencies]], a long-settled region north of Coruscant, generally looked outward, whether to [[Nouane (Allied Region)|Nouane]], the worlds of the Hydian Way, or the [[New Territories/Legends|New Territories]] beyond. Some of the galaxy\\'s greatest traders, explorers and entrepreneurs hailed from the Northern Dependencies, and the region included some of the galaxy\\'s eldest worlds, rarely troubling itself with Core World politics. To its northeast, the region north of the Perlemian Trade Route, was the [[Trans-Hydian]], an area dotted with worlds with ancient histories, such as [[Mandalore/Legends|Mandalore]] or the planets of the [[Sith Worlds]] and the [[Tion Cluster/Legends|Tion Cluster]], but largely sidelined economically until late in galactic history. Economic development jumped from the Slice to the [[Trailing Sectors/Legends|Trailing Sectors]] further south, and then followed the Hydian Way into the New Territories. For millennia, the threat of the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]], rumors of the ancient Sith, and geographic oddities such as the vast [[Radama Void]] encouraged more profitable enterprises elsewhere. The Trans-Hydian owed its name to traders from [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] and [[Celanon/Legends|Celanon]], who braved the threat of Mandalorian raiders to blaze new trade routes like the [[Listehol Run]], the [[Shaltin Tunnels/Legends|Shaltin Tunnels]] and the [[Gordian Reach/Legends|Gordian Reach]] to link the Hydian and the Perlemian. After the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the region\\'s loyalties were split between the Empire and the New Republic, earning it the name of the [[Trans-Hydian|Borderland Regions]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Trailing Sectors/Legends|Trailing Sectors]] were settled during the [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|Alsakan Conflicts]], which saw many colonies in the Slice ruined, enslaved or depopulated, pushing colonization west of the Corellian Run. Here, intrepid traders had long done business with the Herglics, [[Givin/Legends|Givin]] and [[Tynnan/Legends|Tynnans]], and the Expansion Region\\'s Trailing Sectors soon outstripped the Slice sectors, jumpstarting expansion into the Mid Rim. The rise of the Rimma Trade Route in [[5500 BBY/Legends|5500 BBY]] and the Hydian Way two thousand years later furthered this long boom, knitting the region together for traders from across the galaxy. Denizens of the Trailing Sectors tended to view their region as having built on the successes and traditions of the Slice while disregarding its mistakes, valuing entrepreneurship and and hard work.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Western Reaches/Legends|Western Reaches]] grew up around the Corellian Trade Spine and the Hydian Way, with settlement flowing in from the Southern Core and the Trailing Sectors and inheriting those regions\\' diversity and sense of independence. Explorers and settlers continued to expand the region as late as the period of the New Republic, pushing further west into the Unknown Regions. The Reaches\\' independence and distance from Coruscant historically made them a hotbed of rebellion, being the refuge for the [[Separatist holdouts/Legends|last holdouts]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] after the Clone Wars. The Galactic Empire launched [[Western Reaches Operation|a massive campaign]] to pacify the Western Reaches, but the area remained a refuge for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] throughout the Galactic Civil War and was the site of many Imperial atrocities.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[New Territories/Legends|New Territories]] were beyond the Northern Dependencies in a region that had developed slowly in contrast to much of the galaxy. Worlds such as [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]], Ord Mantell and Iridonia were well known, but they were isolated outposts. Large-scale efforts to promote settlement in the northern quadrant repeatedly failed, leading to disasters like the [[Kanz Disorders/Legends|Kanz Disorders]] and the [[Outer Expansion Zone/Legends|Outer Expansion Zone]]. The region was finally properly settled in the final years of the Republic, with the [[D\\'Asta family|D\\'Asta merchant family]] of [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno]] establishing markets along the [[Braxant Run/Legends|Braxant Run]] while the [[Nalroni Merchant Council]] expanded along the [[Celanon Spur/Legends|Celanon Spur]]. These economic successes encouraged Coruscant to invest heavily in the region, soon dubbed the New Territories, and between Republic spending on programs like the [[Planetary Pioneers]] and the influence of the D\\'Asta family, the region was strongly [[Loyalist/Legends|Loyalist]] during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. The New Territories was the core of many Imperial successor states after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], and it became the contested frontier between the New Republic and the [[Imperial Remnant]]. The New Territories were devastated during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], and struggled to rebound afterwards.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n==Traffic routes==\\n[[File:Corellia_Antilles_Atlas.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henrietya Antilles|Corellia Antilles]] views a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] of the galaxy with its major trade routes highlighted.]]\\nClear and stable paths through [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], known as [[hyperlane]]s or hyperroutes, were the essential bedrock of galactic civilization. Hyperlanes provided safe trails for [[Starship/Legends|starships]] around the dangerous gravitic \"[[Mass shadow/Legends|mass shadows]]\" left in hyperspace by objects in [[Realspace/Legends|realspace]]. These routes were explored and established by [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] known as [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] [[Scout/Legends|explorers]] such as like [[Aitro Koornacht]] and [[Jori Daragon|Jori]] and [[Gav Daragon]]. Following are noteworthy routes that had shaped galactic history.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n===The super-hyperroutes===\\nThe [[Super-hyperroute/Legends|super-hyperroutes]] were the largest, longest and fastest hyperlanes in the galaxy, with several stretching from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] all the way to the edge of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]]. The two oldest were the [[Perlemian Trade Route/Legends|Perlemian Trade Route]] and the [[Corellian Run/Legends|Corellian Run]], both blazed after the development of the [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] in [[25,000 BBY/Legends|25,000 BBY]]. The Perlemian formed the northern border of [[The Slice/Legends|the Slice]] and linked the galactic capital of Coruscant to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] training world of [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]] and the civilizations of the [[Tion Hegemony/Legends|Tion Hegemony]]. Early in the Republic\\'s history, colonies and species along the breadth of the Perlemian appealed for Republic protection from the Tionese or the Hutts, fuelling the quick expansion of the young Republic. The Perlemian, known poetically as \"the Axis\", was dominated by [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]] early in the Republic\\'s history, beginning the socio-economic divide that fuelled the [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|Alsakan Conflicts]].<ref name=\"EGW\" /> The Perlemian emptied into Wild Space at the galaxy\\'s fringe beyond [[Quermia/Legends|Quermia]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Corellian Run/Legends|Corellian Run]] ensured the economic dominance of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] within the emerging Republic and formed the southern border of the Slice. The portion of the Run Coreward of Corellia, known as \"[[the Spin]]\", was dominated by Coruscant early in the Republic\\'s history, forming the divide with the Spin and Alsakan.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Rimward of Corellia, however, [[Corellian/Legends|Corellians]] and Humans of Corellian descent dominated and held substantial economic power in the sectors surrounding the Run for millennia afterwards. With the two eldest hyperroutes quickly established, it was much easier to explore in and around the Slice, causing a population boom that accounted for the galaxy\\'s settlement patterns.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Corellian Trade Spine/Legends|Corellian Trade Spine]] was established in [[5500 BBY/Legends|5500 BBY]], although the first led existed as far back as 25,000 BBY, linking Corellia and Duro. The Trade Spine intersected the [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]] at [[Yag\\'Dhul/Legends|Yag\\'Dhul]] before extending Rimward to the [[Greater Javin/Legends|Greater Javin]] and past [[Terminus/Legends|Terminus]]. While offering rapid transit into the galactic southern quadrant, the Corellian Trade Spine never provided the same economic benefits as the [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]]. Established around the same time, the Rimma was plotted by [[Givin/Legends|Givin]] hyperspatial cartographers and blazed by [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] scouts out of [[Herglic Space]]. The Rimma helped usher in widespread colonization of the southern quadrant and enriched the worlds of the [[Tapani sector/Legends|Tapani sector]] in the Colonies. Significant planets on the Rimma included the rich industrialized world of [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]] on the junction with the [[Hydian Way/Legends|Hydian Way]], the [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] homeworld of [[Clak\\'dor VII]], and the shipyards of [[Sluis Van/Legends|Sluis Van]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe last super-hyperroute to be established, the [[Hydian Way/Legends|Hydian Way]], was the only one to span the entire length of the galaxy. Created almost entirely due to the efforts of the [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal]]-based scout [[Freia Kallea/Legends|Freia Kallea]], around [[3700 BBY/Legends|3700 BBY]] she extended the ancient [[Brentaal–Denon Route]] east, linking several obscure routes into a single passage that extended to the northern quadrant\\'s galactic edge. She then pushed south of [[Denon/Legends|Denon]], blazing new routes to the Rim of the galaxy in the southern quadrant and opening great swaths of space to new colonization.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n===Additional routes of interest===\\nThe [[Metellos Trade Route/Legends|Metellos Trade Route]] was oriented west of Coruscant into [[the Negs]] as a failed attempt to discover a western analogue to the Perlemian Trade Route. Initially promising, its expansion stalled in the face of the hyperspace eddies close to the Unknown Regions, and explorers were able to extend its length only a few light-years each century until it eventually terminated in the [[Farlax sector]]. A more successful Core Worlds hyperroute was the [[Koros Trunk Line/Legends|Koros Trunk Line]], an ancient pre-Republic route linking Coruscant to the [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] mines of the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]]. Carbonite was essential to keeping the passengers of [[Sleeper ship/Legends|sleeper ships]] in [[Suspended animation/Legends|suspended animation]], and the route carried so much ore after the development of the hyperdrive that it became known as the Carbonite Pipeline.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Salin Corridor/Legends|Salin Corridor]] was one of the oldest hyperlanes in the Outer Rim, first forged by [[Xim/Legends|Xim the Despot\\'s]] [[Xim\\'s empire|empire]] as the Warrior\\'s Trace to support his [[Xim Wars|wars]] with the Hutts, and maintained by a \"lighthouse network\" of [[Hyperspace beacon/Legends|jump beacons]]. While many of the Xim-era beacons had long-since vanished, the stability of parts of the Salin Corridor was unusual and had intrigued hyperspace theorists for millennia. One of the longest routes in the Outer Rim, it began amid the Hutt-controlled Rim worlds near Aduba, meandered Coreward around the tip of Hutt Space, before turning north into the edges of the [[Tion Cluster/Legends|Tion Cluster]]. From there it skirted the [[Radama Void]], intersected the Hydian Way at [[Botajef/Legends|Botajef]], and emptied in the northern quadrant.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Braxant Run/Legends|Braxant Run]] was the northern quadrant\\'s most important route, beginning at [[Bandomeer/Legends|Bandomeer]] on the Hydian and twisting across the New Territories via [[Muunilinst/Legends|Muunilinst]] to [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]]. The third of the Outer Rim\\'s three most important routes, the [[Triellus Trade Route/Legends|Triellus Trade Route]] spanned more than 75,000 light-years from [[Centares/Legends|Centares]] to [[Enarc (Enarc system)|Enarc]], forming one side of the \"[[Spice Triangle/Legends|Spice Triangle]]\". However, travel along the \"Hutt Highway\" was slow and often dangerous owing to smugglers, slavers and pirates operating out of Hutt Space.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Ootmian Pabol/Legends|\\'\\'Ootmian Pabol\\'\\']] connected the financial hubs of the Expansion Region with the heart of [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]]. A corruption of the [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]] \\'\\'Ootmian Pankapolla\\'\\', it was forged from [[Gyndine/Legends|Gyndine]] around [[12,000 BBY/Legends|12,000 BBY]] by Republic scouts to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. Thriving trade turned Nal Hutta\\'s moon [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] into a boomworld. However, the [[Supernova/Legends|supernova]] of the star of the [[Kyyr system]] in [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]] made the route unnavigable. The \\'\\'Ootmian\\'\\' was eventually restored, but the rise of the Corellian Run finished Nar Shaddaa as a respectable tradeworld, with legitimate business moving elsewhere and the moon becoming one of the galaxy\\'s most notorious [[Shadowport/Legends|shadowports]]. It was speculated that the Kyyr supernova was thus responsible for the shift of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Kajidic/Legends|\\'\\'kajidics\\'\\']] towards criminal enterprises.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThere were some routes that were used for more illegal purposes, in particular the illicit trade of smuggling. One of the most infamous examples of illegal routes was the [[Kessel Run/Legends|Kessel Run]], an 18.5 [[Parsec/Legends|parsec]] three-stop route between Kessel and an area south of the [[Si\\'Klaata Cluster/Legends|Si\\'Klaata Cluster]] that was used during the reign of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] by [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] who were smuggling [[Glitterstim/Legends|Glitterstim]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]] to the latter location without being caught by Imperial ships. Besides the two aforementioned locations, it also connected to the [[Kessel Trade Corridor]], the [[Triellus Trade Route/Legends|Triellus Trade Route]], and the [[Pabol Sleheyron/Legends|\\'\\'Pabol Sleheyron\\'\\']] routes. The notorious smuggler Han Solo claimed to have navigated the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs with his ship, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|\\'\\'Millennium Falcon\\'\\']], by skirting close to the [[Black hole/Legends|black holes]] that made up part of the Kessel Run.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Ison Corridor]] was a fairly small route within the Corellian Trade Spine, which had five system stops before reconnecting with the Spine, and was connected from the coreward region to the rimward region.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Sisar Run/Legends|Sisar Run]] was a hyperspace trade route originating in the [[Tharin sector]], where it passed through the heart of the Periphery, passing through Hutt Space and Srillur and bypassing the Si\\'Klatta Cluster before it splits at Sispe. It junctions with the [[Salin Corridor/Legends|Salin Corridor]], the [[Pabol Hutta/Legends|\\'\\'Pabol Hutta\\'\\']], the \\'\\'Pabol Sleheyron\\'\\', and the [[Ac\\'fren Spur]] routes.<ref name=\"Sisar\">\\'\\'[[Secrets of the Sisar Run]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\n[[Myto\\'s Arrow/Legends|Myto\\'s Arrow]], named after its discoverer, the Galactic Republic scout [[Keos Myto]], was a route located in the Outer Rim that was used for travel between the [[Raioballo sector/Legends|Raioballo sector]] via [[Dantooine]] and the [[Obtrexta sector]]. This route was connected with the [[Veragi Trade Route/Legends|Veragi Trade Route]] and the [[Braxant Run/Legends|Braxant Run]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Daragon Trail]], well known for being the longest blind jump to have been made successfully in the history of the galaxy, travelled between Korriban in the Outer Rim and Empress Teta (which at the time of the route\\'s discovery was named Koros Major) in the Deep Core. It was named after Gav and Jori Daragon, the couple who discovered the route in [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]]. Portions of it were merged with the smuggling route [[Carbonite Run/Legends|Carbonite Run]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n==Government and politics==\\n===Senatorial representation===\\nUnder the Galactic Republic, the peoples of the galaxy were represented in the [[Legislature|legislative body]] known as the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. Originally, any sufficiently-populated [[Star system/Legends|star system]] would return a [[Senator/Legends|senator]], but this was soon rejected as a recipe for gridlock as the Republic expanded massively and thousands of delegates attended Senate meetings. The Planetary Senate gave way to [[Sector/Legends|sectorial]] representation: the Republic was divided into sectors containing no more than fifty inhabited systems - it was feared that larger sectors would form the seeds of breakaway empires - which were each represented by a single sectorial senator. However, the price of passing this amendment was additional legislation that allowed many of the Republic\\'s [[Core Founder/Legends|Core Founders]] to retain their planetary seats, giving extra votes to the most powerful Core and Colonies sectors.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nTo strict [[Galactic Constitution/Legends|Galactic Constitutionalists]], this was the Republic\\'s \"founding tyranny\", a cynical scheme to preserve the power of the Core systems. Indeed, the awarding of single-system votes caused such an outcry that a compromise was reached: anyone recognized as a [[Associate Planetary Representative|representative]] of a single system had the right to petition the full Senate, a right still occasionally invoked under the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nSectors grew to include thousands of star systems, but even with the \"rule of fifty\" widely ignored, the Republic expanded to include millions of sectors by [[17,000 BBY]], once again rendering the galaxy ungovernable. In the aftermath of the [[First Alsakan Conflict]], the [[Challat Compromise]] was adopted, which split the legislature into a seated Senate, whose members had full rights of address, and an unseated Senate, whose members had to petition for such rights. Predictably, the seated senators became power-brokers, and corruption thrived, with unseated senators having to trade the vast majority of their votes for the chance to be heard in the Senate.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Ruusan Reformation]]s of [[1000 BBY]] saw a remarkable dismantling of central authority and reorganized the Republic into 1,024 regional sectors, each represented by a single senator, though once again a series of exceptions favored planets in the Core and Colonies. Additionally, the right of representation was extended to so-called [[Functional constituency|functional constituencies]] representing discreet cultural and species enclaves. While the galaxy was once again governable, the Reformations inevitably placed power into the hands of a very few, especially when the definition of functional constituencies was extended in [[124 BBY]] to the galaxy\\'s mightiest guilds and corporations, chief among them the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]]. The Trade Federation bought up vast blocs of votes from poor sectors and gained control of key appointments in the bureaucracy, and by the time of the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]] was the Senate\\'s greatest power and paralyzed the Senate in the face of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n[[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] stripped the Senate of most of its power during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] and dissolved the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]] entirely in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. The [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] restored the body, but it inevitably again became mired in gridlock, archaic tradition, and corruption. When the New Republic was reorganized into the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]] during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], the very name of the new state seemed to be an acceptance of the need for decentralization of power. However, efforts to rehabilitate the galaxy after the Yuuzhan Vong War depended heavily on centralized power, leading to the rebellion of independent-minded systems in a [[Confederation]] led by [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], and so the ancient problem of galactic democracy begun a [[Second Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n===Client states and Allied Regions===\\n[[File:Hutt_rgb_lg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]] was a large stretch of the Outer and Mid Rims, dominated by the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]], that eluded central control for millennia.]]\\nThe [[Allied Region]]s were independent states that freely joined the Galactic Republic as it expanded early in its history, with their rulers receiving the honorary title of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]]. By the time of the Clone Wars, most Allied Regions had been divided into sectors, but a handful endured as regions with a discreet cultural identity, such as the [[Trailing Sectors/Legends|Trailing Sectors]] or the [[New Territories/Legends|New Territories]]; or a sector dominated by a single species, such as [[Trianii Space]]. Several of these governments survived as [[Imperial client state|client states]] under the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and maintained a degree of independence, and were recognized by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] afterwards.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n[[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]] referred to the large stretch of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Rimward]] [[The Slice/Legends|Slice]] controlled by the [[Hutt Ruling Council]], the governing body of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] species. Originally powerful warriors, the [[Hutt Empire]] [[Xim Wars|overthrew]] the [[Xim\\'s empire|empire]] of [[Xim/Legends|Xim the Despot]], but a disastrous civil war around [[15,000 BBY/Legends|15,000 BBY]] known as the [[Hutt Cataclysms]] forced a cultural reformation, beginning a new philosophy known as [[Kajidic/Legends|\\'\\'kajidic\\'\\']], which stressed economic dominance over outright conquest. Hutt Space\\'s borders ebbed and flowed over the millennia but the Hutts\\' power in both the economic and the criminal spheres endured, extending as far Coreward as [[Gyndine/Legends|Gyndine]] as the Galactic Republic decayed during the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]]. Hutt Space was nominally part of the Galactic Empire, but the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]] largely tolerated the Hutts\\' criminal dealings, as the Hutt Ruling Council was a known quantity as opposed to the possibility of hundreds of feuding Hutt crime lords. Hutt Space was devastated during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], but recovered surprisingly quickly, bringing with it a renewed Hutt militarism that was expressed when the region declared for the [[Confederation]] during the [[Second Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n[[File:Corporate_sector.jpg||thumb|left|200px|The [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], on the edge of the [[Tingel Arm/Legends|Tingel Arm]], was a business-dominated Imperial exclave.]]\\nThe [[Corporate Sector Authority/Legends|Corporate Sector Authority]] (CSA) referred to the government of the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], a region of close to thirty thousand star systems on the edge of the [[Tingel Arm/Legends|Tingel Arm]] ruled from [[Etti IV/Legends|Etti IV]], and was a collective of businesses and corporations granted exclusive rights to all resources in the territory. The experiment in corporate governance, while protecting the rights of workers, began after lessons were learned from the [[Outer Expansion Zone scandal]]. At the suggestion of [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Orman Tagge/Legends|Orman Tagge]], the Corporate Sector was vastly expanded under the Galactic Empire and it became an officially-sanctioned refuge for [[Loyalist/Legends|Loyalist]] corporations seeking to avoid [[Imperialization/Legends|nationalization]]. The CSA became the region\\'s sole owner, employer, government, and military, while corporations that invested in the Authority would receive proportional shares of the profits.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Centrality/Legends|Centrality]] was a long strip of territory to the north of Hutt Space, founded as a libertarian independent state in [[3350 BBY]]. [[Human/Legends|Human]]-dominated, the capital of [[Erilnar]] often fell under the influence of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Kajidic/Legends|\\'\\'kajidics\\'\\']], which were often the beneficiaries of the profits of the Centrality\\'s main export, the [[life-crystal]]s of [[Rafa V]]. The Centrality was formally an Imperial territory, but was generally left alone by [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]]. Emperor Palpatine\\'s sole act concerning the region occurred several years prior to the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], when he gave \\'\\'de facto\\'\\' control of the Centrality to [[Rokur Gepta]], [[Sorcerers of Tund/Legends|Sorcerer of Tund]], who was later killed by [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] in defense of the region\\'s native [[Oswaft]] at the [[Battle of ThonBoka]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]] was the [[Monarchy/Legends|monarchical]] government of the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]], located in the [[Inner Rim]]. Isolationist and matriarchal, the secretive [[Hapan]]s became legendary for their reputed wealth, beauty, pride, and aristocratic feuds. Emperor Palpatine\\'s tolerance of the region\\'s independence surprised many, and it was suggested that the Emperor maintained Hapes as a lesson to the galaxy in the dangers of insularity and decadence. The Hapes Consortium opened its borders after the [[Declaration of a New Republic/Legends|Declaration of a New Republic]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n[[File:HapesClusterMap-TEA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]] was an isolationist grouping of 63 inhabited worlds ruled by the matriarchal [[Queen Mother]]s.]]\\nThe [[Atrisian Commonwealth]] was a region of two hundred planets in the Core Worlds near the Unknown Regions. The political, diplomatic and military writings of [[Atrisia/Legends|Atrisia]], in particular the \\'\\'[[Sayings]]\\'\\' of [[Uueg Tching]], had been studied for millennia. The insular territory declared independence after Emperor Palpatine\\'s death at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] but later accepted Allied Region status in the New Republic. Similarly, [[Nouane (Allied Region)|Nouane]] began as a thriving Inner Rim empire beyond the Slice, and was renowned for its philosophers and thinkers, in particular the controversial [[Four Sages of Dwartii/Legends|Four Sages of Dwartii]]. Nouanese ministers were common in the young Republic, and the territory sought Allied Region status after being ravaged by the [[Mandalorian Crusaders]] in [[3963 BBY]]. The region of 212 planets was a loyal supporter of the Empire and declared independence under the New Republic.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n[[Bothan sector|Bothan Space]] included some 150 settled systems in the Mid Rim, dominated by [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] colonists and ruled by the [[Bothan Council]]. One of the few species close to Hutt Space to preserve their independence, the Bothans were credited with the diplomacy and espionage that preserved the stability of much of the Mid Rim. Bothan Space was one of the first regions to declare its support for the New Republic in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Botor Enclave]] and the [[Daupherm Planet States]] were two adjoining territories on the edge of the Core. The ursine [[Botori]] controlled two dozen star systems within a nebula while the Human [[Dawferim]] controlled just over thirty systems. The two states had fought no less than forty wars even after they accepted Allied Region status under the Galactic Republic, and both declared independence after the Declaration of a New Republic.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n[[Herglic Space]] referred to the shrunken remnant of the [[Herglic Trade Empire]]. It consisted of some forty star systems around the [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]], but hundreds of worlds along the Rimma outside Herglic Space had substantial [[Herglic/Legends|Herglic]] populations. Herglic Space was brutally suppressed under the Empire but regained Allied Region status under the New Republic and the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\nThe [[Ktilac Regions]] were a confederacy off the Perlemian Trade Route in the Inner Rim ruled by three species - the [[Ktilac]]s, the [[Murachaun]], and the [[Tocoyan]]s. Religiously fundamentalist, the region had evolved a common culture where each species was seen as complementary to the other two and the rest of the galaxy was seen as unholy. Each species ruled sixty-three star systems while another three were open to outlanders under strict conditions. The Regions maintained Allied Region status under the Galactic Alliance.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n[[Paqwepori]] was a small cluster of ninety rich star systems just off the Corellian Run in the Mid Rim. [[Paqwepor Major]]\\'s bazaars were popular destinations for Republic traders expanding the Corellian Run for eons. The Paqwepori were known for their love of business and ambition while despising any law that could limit individual expression or initiative.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\\n\\n==Economy==\\n{{Main|Galactic economy}}\\nThe spread of technology and civilization throughout the galaxy led to the development of the [[galactic economy]], the system of production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods. Few planets were entirely self-sufficient, with some, such as the [[Factory world/Legends|factory worlds]] of [[Telti/Legends|Telti]] and [[Mechis III/Legends|Mechis III]], devoting their economies solely to the production of high-tech goods but relying on [[Agriworld/Legends|agriworlds]] for food.

In the years prior to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]], a conglomerate of shipping and merchant cartels, controlled the votes of hundreds of star systems in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] by making their commerce dependent on its [[Trade Federation Merchant Fleet|Merchant Fleet]] and enforcing deals with the [[Trade Defense Force]].<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Companies such as the [[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub Corporation]], which under the Empire outright controlled the government of the planet [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]], produced goods for hundreds of fields. [[Tagge Corporation|TaggeCo]] controlled hundreds of star systems and dozens of subsidiaries, making it one of the galaxy\\'s most influential organizations.

Humans exist in both galaxies, and Galactic Basic is essentially the same as modern-day [[Wikipedia:English language|English]], including (but not limited to) its [[Wikipedia:British English|British]], [[Wikipedia:American English|American]], [[Wikipedia:New Zealand English|New Zealander]], [[Wikipedia:Caribbean English|Caribbean]], and [[Wikipedia:Indian English|Indian]] variants. Additionally, many cultural traditions (from the [[handshake]] to [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]]) are similar or identical in both galaxies, but these similarities remain unexplained.\\n\\nSimilarly, the time frame the galaxy and the events occurring in it occurred in compared to that of Earth is not made clear other than the opening words declaring that they took place \"A long time ago.\" It should be noted that, originally, when George Lucas was writing the first film in its [[The Star Wars: Story Synopsis|initial treatment]], he had intended for the galaxy to not only occur within the same galaxy as our own, but the time frame would have been specifically cited as occurring within the thirty-third century.<ref name=\"How Star Wars Conquered the Universe\">Chris Taylor.

That was back in 1969. Then when Warner Brothers cancelled the funding for Zoetrope, the project was abandoned for a while. After the success of \\'American Graffiti\\' in 1973, George wanted to revive it, but it was still too hot a topic, the [Vietnam] war was still on, and nobody wanted to finance something like that. So George considered his options: What did he really want to say in \\'Apocalypse Now?\\' The message boiled down to the ability of a small group of people to defeat a gigantic power simply by the force of their convictions. And he decided, All right, if it\\'s politically too hot as a contemporary subject, I\\'ll put the essence of the story in outer space and make it happen in a galaxy long ago and far away. The rebel group were the North Vietnamese, and the Empire was the United States.

The first maps of the \\'\\'Star Wars\\'\\' galaxy were published in [[roleplaying game]] sourcebooks by [[West End Games]], and contained detail maps of regions and sectors. The [[Elrood sector/Legends|Elrood sector]] was mapped in \\'\\'[[Planets of the Galaxy, Volume Three]]\\'\\', the [[Brak sector]] in \\'\\'[[Flashpoint! Brak Sector]]\\'\\', the [[Kathol sector]] in \\'\\'[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]\\'\\', and the [[Tapani sector/Legends|Tapani sector]] and the [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]] in \\'\\'[[Lords of the Expanse]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\"Charting\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-maps-charting-the-galaxy|text=\\'\\'Star Wars\\'\\' Maps: Charting the Galaxy}}</ref>\\n\\nDespite these partial maps, it would not be until [[1998]], with the release of the CD-ROM digital encyclopedia \\'\\'[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]\\'\\' that the first full, official galactic map was released. This map placed the most important planets from the films and the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]]. The map provided a top-down view of the \\'\\'Star Wars\\'\\' galaxy, with concentric rings indicating the various regions from the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], as well as placing [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], which would feature in the upcoming [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|\\'\\'The Phantom Menace\\'\\']].<ref name=\"Charting\" />\\n\\n[[1999]] saw the release of [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|\\'\\'The New Jedi Order\\'\\']] series, which included a detailed galactic map in each novel that tracked the course of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War|Yuuzhan Vong invasion]]. The maps in these books showed an isometric projection of the galaxy, and included the spiral arms and empty galactic west known as the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Each novel included the same basic map, which mapped planets from the existing lore as well as newly visited worlds of the \\'\\'New Jedi Order\\'\\' stories. [[2000]]\\'s [[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|\\'\\'The Essential Chronology\\'\\']] used the same map in its endpapers.<ref name=\"Charting\" />\\n\\n\\'\\'[[Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Episode I]]\\'\\', also released in 2000, returned to a map using concentric circles, similar to the \\'\\'Behind the Magic\\'\\' map, but with broadly similar planet placements to \\'\\'The New Jedi Order\\'\\' map. Other maps, however, beginning with \\'\\'[[Star Wars Gamer 5]]\\'\\', elaborated on the concept of \\'\\'The New Jedi Order\\'\\' map, and increasingly-detailed color maps were published in some issues of \\'\\'[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]\\'\\' ([[The Official Star Wars Fact File 1|1]], [[The Official Star Wars Fact File 56|56]], [[The Official Star Wars Fact File 139|139]]). A large poster map was provided in [[2003]]\\'s [[Star Wars Insider 65|\\'\\'Star Wars Insider\\'\\' 65]], and \\'\\'[[The New Essential Chronology]]\\'\\' of [[2005]] also had a spread with an updated galaxy map and its most notable systems, and was the first to mark the locations of the planets of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|\\'\\'Revenge of the Sith\\'\\']].<ref name=\"Charting\" />\\n\\n2009 saw the release of \\'\\'[[The Essential Atlas]]\\'\\', which did away with isometric projections in favor of a top-down chart, while keeping regional borders and planet placements largely the same. As well as a large galaxy map, \\'\\'The Essential Atlas\\'\\' also included numerous historical, regional, and sectoral maps and developed a coordinate system and galactic compass. In addition, \\'\\'The Essential Atlas\\'\\' included an index of 4,387 [[Star system/Legends|star systems]], assigning each a coordinate, sector and region. \\'\\'The Essential Atlas\\'\\' has since been expanded with an [[Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion|Online Companion]], which includes an updated index placing 5,085 star systems, believed to be every system mentioned in \\'\\'[[Star Wars Legends]]\\'\\', as well as maps of the sectors of the Outer Rim, Mid Rim, and Expansion Region.<ref name=\"Charting\" />\\n\\n<gallery>\\nFile:Btm-map.jpg|The map of the galaxy from \\'\\'[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]\\'\\'.\\nFile:NJO galaxy map.jpg|The map featured in [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|\\'\\'The New Jedi Order\\'\\']] series and [[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|\\'\\'The Essential Chronology\\'\\']].\\nFile:GalaxymapISTW.jpg|A map of the galaxy included in \\'\\'[[Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Episode I]]\\'\\'.

The [[1998]] video game [[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|\\'\\'Star Wars: Rebellion\\'\\']] would provide an interface of a galaxy map divided up into 20 sectors and 200 systems; however, these positions are provided only as a game mechanic and have been contradicted by later official sources.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://starwarsatlas.uw.hu/rebellion2.htm|title=List of \\'\\'Rebellion\\'\\' sectors and planets and their correctness|author=Modi|archivedate=20200105150512}}</ref>\\n\\n<gallery>\\nFile:TF-map.jpg|A \"map\" of the galaxy in \\'\\'TIE Fighter\\'\\'.

That series featured the character [[Breha (The Star Wars)|Breha of Aquilae]], drawn by [[Mike Mayhew]]<ref name=\"TSW1\">[[The Star Wars 1|\\'\\'The Star Wars\\'\\' 1]]</ref> in a style that resembles a [[:File:Scary Lira.png|concept drawing]] of Princess Leia in [[Cloud City]], originally made by [[Ralph McQuarrie]] for [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|\\'\\'Star Wars\\'\\': Episode V \\'\\'The Empire Strikes Back\\'\\']].<ref>\\'\\'[[The Art of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nGeorge Lucas resurrected the character early in the production of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|\\'\\'Star Wars\\'\\': Episode III \\'\\'Revenge of the Sith\\'\\']], the third installment of the \\'\\'Star Wars\\'\\' [[prequel trilogy]]. In [[December]] [[2002]], he informed his production staff that Princess Leia\\'s surrogate mother would appear in the movie. Lucas described her as a trustworthy, peaceful woman in her mid-thirties, and illustrator [[Iain McCaig]] drew several conceptual artworks based on that description. In one of his drawings, McGaig gave Breha the traits of Padmé Amidala, in an attempt to explain how Leia could remember seeing the smile of her mother.

When her brothers helped her understand that the Queen was none other than the adopted mother of Princess Leia, her excitement over the role increased. Rebecca Jackson Mendoza remembered having watched the original trilogy as a child, wishing she could be Princess Leia. In light of all that, Jackson Mendoza came to regard that role as something of an accomplishment.<ref name=\"Beacon\">{{SWArchive|url=episode-iii/bts/production/beacon161.html|text=Homing Beacon #161 - Revenge\\'s Royalty|archivedate=20061201041244}} Royalty}}</ref>\\n\\nA single robe, referred to as the \"Alderaan Palace Dress\" in \\'\\'[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]\\'\\',<ref name=\"DAG\">\\'\\'[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]\\'\\'</ref> was created for Jackson Mendoza by [[Trisha Biggar]], who worked as costume designer for all three prequel films.

Gray said it actually staggered her to realize how little had been written about Breha, who had such a central position in the narrative of \\'\\'Star Wars\\'\\', being Leia\\'s adopted mother, and a queen at the core of the Rebellion.
