The illegitimate daughter to the famous Echani [[General/Legends|General]] [[Yusanis]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arren Kae]], both of whom fought in the [[Mandalorian Wars]], she later served along with her five half-sisters as the [[Handmaiden Sisters]] under Jedi Master [[Atris]] in the period following the [[Jedi Civil War]]. During her service to Atris at the [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]] on [[Telos IV]], Brianna met [[Meetra Surik]], also known as the Jedi Exile, and was subsequently tasked with accompanying her on her mission to seek out the [[Lost Jedi]], Jedi Masters who survived the [[First Jedi Purge]]. As Surik\\'s companion, Brianna helped battle against numerous adversaries, including the [[Sith Triumvirate]].\\n\\nDuring the journey, Brianna trained Surik in [[Echani (martial art)/Legends|Echani]] techniques and eventually received [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]] from Surik in return, becoming one of the [[Lost Jedi|first new members]] of the Jedi Order after the Purge. In accepting such training, however, she broke her oath to Atris. The Jedi Master labeled her a traitor, resulting in a confrontation between Brianna, her sisters and her former master. According to the predictions of [[Kreia]], Brianna would become instrumental in the reconstruction of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and succeed Atris as its lead [[Jedi historian]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n===Early life===\\n{{Quote|I knew her mother. She was a Jedi Knight&mdash;a master, named Arren Kae. Jedi are forbidden to have children, and when the crime finally came to light almost a decade later, Kae was exiled. She joined the Mandalorian Wars after the shame of her birth was revealed.|Kreia|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Briannafull.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brianna, the last handmaiden]]\\nBrianna was born in [[3976 BBY]]<ref name=\"age\" /> as the result of a forbidden union between [[General/Legends|General]] [[Yusanis]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arren Kae]]. Yusanis, a master [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] combatant of the Republic world [[Eshan/Legends|Eshan]], was married to another woman to whom he had five daughters, while Kae, as a member of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] was forbidden to form strong attachments. Despite these restrictions, the couple began a secret relationship, risking their status by continuing to meet. Despite Kae\\'s attempts to keep the affair and Brianna\\'s existence a secret, the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] eventually found out about the situation, and Kae was [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled from the Jedi Order]] as punishment.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nKae later chose to join her former apprentice, [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], to fight the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]], who were bent on [[Mandalorian Wars|conquering the Outer Rim]]. Yusanis joined them, despite the fact that he was responsible for the care of Brianna and his other five daughters. Yusanis and Kae became known as heroes of the conflict, but Kae eventually fell in battle, and Yusanis returned a broken man, abandoning battle to become a [[Senator/Legends|senator]]. He avoided speaking of Kae, leaving Brianna with no memories of her mother. Later, Yusanis\\'s old ally Revan declared himself the new [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and turned on the Jedi, starting the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He sought to weaken the Republic, and targeted the Republic worlds of [[Serroco]], [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] and [[Eshan/Legends|Eshan]] for destabilization. Revan accomplished his goals by assassinating a senator from each world, and the death of an Echani senator caught Yusanis\\' attention. When Yusanis found evidence of the act, he challenged Revan to a duel, but was ultimately slain by the Dark Lord, leaving Brianna an orphan.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSometime after Yusanis\\'s death, Brianna and her five half-sisters entered the service of Jedi Master [[Atris]], one of the few Masters who survived the Jedi Civil War. The Jedi Order had been greatly divided and weakened by the war, and further attacks by a resurgent [[Sith Triumvirate|Sith Order]] after the war\\'s conclusion left very few Jedi remaining. Atris hoped to revive the Jedi Order after most of the other Jedi Masters had been [[Conclave at Katarr|killed]] during one of these attacks on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]], and established a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|secret academy]] on [[Telos IV]], a planet that had been [[Bombing of Telos IV|devastated]] by Sith forces during the Jedi Civil War. The sisters joined her in the academy and agreed to serve as her [[handmaiden]]s, aiding Atris in gathering [[Holocron/Legends|Jedi artifacts]] from around the galaxy. At one point during their service, Brianna and her half-sisters swore an oath to Atris that they would never study the teachings of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], nor receive any [[Jedi training/Legends|instruction]] from a Jedi; although Brianna was the only handmaiden who had any [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitivity]] due to her heritage. While Atris knew of Brianna\\'s familial lineage, as well as her sensitivity, she never mentioned Brianna\\'s potential, and the handmaiden remained ignorant of her innate abilities.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nThe offspring of Echani parents appeared to non-Echani to look identical to their parents, typically the one of the same [[Gender/Legends|sex]]. As such, Brianna resembled her Jedi mother and not Yusanis\\' original wife, which distinguished her from her sisters as physical evidence of their father\\'s affair. Her father\\'s infidelity had brought shame on himself; and, after his death at the hands of Revan, that shame was thrust upon her, as the Echani believed that betrayal and shame were passed down through bloodlines. Despite working hard to disprove this stigma that followed her all through her young life, Brianna was branded the \"Last of the Handmaidens\" by her sisters, meaning she was the least of them, in terms of worth and combat ability. As a result, Brianna felt she was unworthy of bearing any signs of individuality and renounced her name in favor of her title.<ref name=\"TSL\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\">\\'\\'[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\n===Meetra Surik\\'s arrival===\\n{{Quote|I will not warn you again. Drop your weapons, or we shall take them from you.|Brianna to Meetra Surik upon the latter\\'s arrival at the Academy.|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_Hawk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Security feed showing Brianna boarding the Ebon Hawk]]\\nThe Jedi Academy was secluded in the isolated polar regions of Telos IV, and consequently, the academy remained unnoticed, even when the Republic began the [[Telosian Restoration Project]] in an effort to restore the ecosystem of the devastated planet. The project was headed by the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Chodo Habat]] and his [[Chodo Habat\\'s herd|herd]], and a massive [[Citadel Station|space station]] was built in orbit as a staging area for the project. When Atris later learned that the planet [[Peragus II]], the main source of the station\\'s fuel had been destroyed and that the [[Telos Security Force]] was holding [[Meetra Surik|suspects]] in the planet\\'s destruction, who had recently arrived in the system, she ordered Brianna to investigate. Acting covertly, Brianna sneaked onto Citadel Station and stole the suspects\\' ship, the \\'\\'[[Ebon Hawk]]\\'\\', as well as their droid, [[T3-M4]], which was aboard as a result of the ship being impounded after arriving at Citadel Station shortly after the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction of]] Peragus II. Brianna then brought the ship to the secret academy where Atris hoped to look into the events surrounding the destruction of the planet. Atris was unaware that the new owner of the ship was a former friend from the Jedi Order,<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Meetra Surik,<ref name=\"revan\">\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'</ref> also known as the Jedi Exile, another hero of the Mandalorian Wars who was exiled for her defiance of the Jedi Council and her decision to join Revan in the war. Surik was released from custody when it was discovered that Peragus II had been destroyed as a result of her escape from the Sith Lord [[Darth Sion]], and she began a search for her stolen ship.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSurik, along with companions [[Kreia]] and [[Atton Rand]], whom she had met on Peragus II, eventually located the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] with some help from a [[Bao-Dur|technician]] of the Restoration Project and entered the academy. Brianna, flanked by two of her sisters, confronted the group and demanded their surrender. Surik agreed so as to avoid a conflict, and Brianna escorted her to meet with Atris. Atris had been one of the masters who decided on Surik\\'s punishment for her involvement in the Mandalorian Wars, and was not pleased to see her again. After a charged discussion over Surik\\'s seeming unrepentant attitude towards her actions in defying the Council, she informed Atris of the Sith\\'s involvement in the destruction of Peragus II, and offered her aid. Atris suggested she seek out the other surviving Jedi Masters and gather them at the ruined Enclave on Dantooine in order to form a plan of action, and sent Surik away. Brianna was startled to have seen her mistress become so volatile, strengthening her growing belief that the Jedi were not the passionless beings Atris had described them to be.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBefore Surik departed Telos, Brianna was able to speak to her in private. Brianna was wary of Surik at first, but began to speak more freely when Surik managed to convince her that, contrary to Atris\\'s opinion, she had not turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] during the Mandalorian Wars. Brianna confessed that she was the only one of her sisters who did not doubt Surik\\'s battle prowess and was more receptive to Surik\\'s opinion. Brianna also mentioned how she was often distracted by the [[Jedi artifact/Legends|Jedi teachings]] Atris had rescued and stored at the academy; and, as a result, was eager to learn about life as a Jedi. She asked about various details of a Jedi\\'s life, including the issue of attachment. Brianna also informed Surik that she always trained to better herself, and they discussed the Echani view of expression of feelings through combat. As one final question, Brianna asked what it was like to feel [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and was satisfied by the answers both Surik and Kreia provided.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Travels with Meetra Surik===\\n{{Quote|I want to fight with you side by side, for as long as there are enemies that threaten you.

While Rand vocally objected to allowing a spy to travel with them, Surik welcomed Brianna to the crew. At this point, however, Brianna was still wary of Surik, as she had been warned by Atris not to trust her. She secluded herself inside the cargo bay so that she could hone her fighting style, while keeping herself separate from the rest of the crew.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_KotORCG.jpg|thumb|180px|Brianna, during her time with Meetra Surik]]\\nWhile Surik attempted to get to know Brianna, the Echani continued to be wary of trusting her, but through acts of kindness and charity during their journey, Brianna finally believed that Atris had been wrong in her judgments. Brianna occasionally clashed with [[Visas Marr]], a former Sith assassin who was initially on a mission to capture Surik. Although Marr joined the crew after her defeat at Surik\\'s hands, Brianna did not trust her due to Marr\\'s ties to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. After some convincing from Surik, Brianna learned to accept her presence, although she still kept a watchful eye on the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]].<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nDuring their travels, Brianna agreed to teach Surik [[Echani (martial art)/Legends|Echani fighting techniques]]. As they trained, Surik challenged Brianna\\'s Echani tradition about sparring while wearing only undergarments; Brianna conceded that bulkier clothes would be more practical. She surprised Surik by then changing into a heavy set of [[Handmaiden\\'s robe|grayed robes]], the style associated with a Jedi Master. When asked, she finally revealed that they were the last keepsake of her mother that she had never known. She opened up to Surik and revealed the story of her past, but she asked that it be kept secret from the rest of the crew, as she had come to trust Surik over everyone else. Unexpectedly, after their private discussion, Surik was approached by Kreia who revealed that she had known Arren Kae. Kreia speculated that because Kae had been strong in the Force, that the potential to become a Jedi also lay within her daughter. Kreia discouraged Surik from training her as a Jedi, however, because it would mean breaking her oath to Atris.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nSurik decided to leave the choice to Brianna, and offered to train her to use the Force. By this point, Brianna greatly trusted Surik and realized that she had hoped to follow her mother\\'s path her entire life. Consequently, she accepted the offer. Surik warned her she would be breaking her oath to Atris, but Brianna was committed, feeling that she would be betraying her heritage if she didn\\'t accept the training. With Brianna\\'s acceptance, Surik passed on her knowledge of the Force to Brianna, and trained her to become a [[Jedi Guardian]]. During this time, Kreia [[Telepathy/Legends|sent a message]] to Atris through the Force telling her of Brianna\\'s choice to become a Jedi with a single word: \"Betrayal.\" As a Jedi, Brianna continued to aid Surik, who eventually succeeded in gathering the Jedi Masters [[Vrook Lamar]], [[Zez-Kai Ell]] and [[Kavar]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. Brianna returned to the Enclave on Dantooine with Surik, who set off to meet with the Masters alone. Unfortunately, when the Masters revealed their intentions to [[Sever Force/Legends|strip]] Surik of the Force due to the danger she posed by her particular ability to [[Wound in the Force|feed off the life energy of others]], Kreia was forced to act and killed the Jedi Masters. Before incapacitating the Exile, Kreia revealed she had been manipulating Surik all along, and that her ultimate goal had been to utilize Surik\\'s unique nature to cease the influence of the Force on all sapients.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Confronting the Sith====\\n{{Quote|You are no longer one of us. You followed the Jedi, betrayed your oath.|The Handmaiden Sisters to Brianna|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\n[[File:Brianna_Sisters.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Brianna\\'s sisters confront her on Telos.]]\\nFollowing the incident on Dantooine, Brianna, believing Surik to be dead, took Kreia directly to Atris, knowing that her mistress would execute any Sith. However, Atris\\'s belief in the Jedi Council\\'s decision during the Mandalorian Wars, as well as her belief in the Order itself, had been shaken after she observed Surik\\'s conviction. In addition, she had been slowly corrupted by her collection of [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]], which she had gathered in hopes of using their teachings to fight the Sith. Instead, the influence of the artifacts proved too strong, and they slowly twisted Atris\\'s thinking, causing her to fall to the dark side.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAtris finally admitted her fall to the dark side after a conversation with Kreia. Simultaneously, the other handmaidens [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|confronted]] Brianna. She learned that Atris had told her sisters that Brianna had fallen to the dark side and joined Surik against Atris\\'s wishes. Brianna could not convince her sisters otherwise, and was forced to fight them. In doing so, she proved herself to have surpassed her sisters in ability, as she managed to defeat them all without killing them. Shortly thereafter, Atris arrived and attacked Brianna. Though Brianna was initially able to keep the corrupt Jedi Master at bay, she was eventually overwhelmed. Atris began [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] her handmaiden with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]; but, before she could deliver the final blow, Surik arrived and defeated Atris in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]]. After the duel, Brianna pledged undying allegiance to Surik, renouncing her title of Last of the Handmaidens, and embracing her true name as well as her status as a disciple of the last Jedi.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBefore leaving Telos, Kreia manipulated the Sith into [[Battle of Telos IV|attacking Citadel Station]], forcing Surik to fight off an assault and help defend the station before she could follow her teacher. Brianna aided Surik and the Telos Security Force in fending off the Sith assault on Citadel Station before joining Surik in pursuit of Kreia. Surik had learned from Atris that Kreia had gone to a [[Trayus Academy|secret Sith academy]] on [[Malachor V]], the site of the [[Battle of Malachor V|final battle]] of the Mandalorian Wars, and the site where Surik had previously lost her connection to the Force after killing countless combatants on both sides by activating the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] during the battle. On this occasion, the Sith Lord intended to use Malachor V&mdash;a site where the Force still echoed from those killed by the Mass Shadow Generator&mdash;to create a [[wound in the Force]], which in turn would allow her to carry out her goal of destroying the Force itself. When the group arrived at Malachor V, however, the massive storms surrounding the planet damaged the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\', causing it to crash. In the crash, the members of the group were separated, and Brianna was unable to help Surik, who went on to [[Battle of Malachor|confront]] Kreia alone.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Legacy===\\nKreia, shortly before her death on Malachor V at the hands of Surik, looked into the future, and told her that Brianna would give up her ways of battle, play a vital role in rebuilding the Jedi Order. According to her, Brianna would follow her passion and take Atris\\'s role as [[Jedi historian|historian]], teaching future [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] about the Jedi who gave up the Force, and became better for it.<ref name=\"TSL\" />{{Endgame}}\\n\\nCenturies later, the [[New Jedi Order]] would also remember Brianna for her role in the Order\\'s history. Brianna was credited as one of the [[Lost Jedi]] and an instrumental companion who aided Surik. Due to the uncertain records of the era, the New Jedi Order tentatively named her as one of the potential slayers of Sith Lord [[Darth Nihilus]], alongside another possible candidate, Visas Marr.<ref name=\"EGttF\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']]</ref>\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\n{{Quote|Well, good thing it\\'s not a trap.\\'\\'\"<br />\"\\'\\'What are you talking about?

She bore the shame of her parents\\' forbidden affair, and as a result strove to prove her worth to her sisters and Atris. Her shame and position as the least worthy among her sisters led her to adopt a style of thinking in which she placed the greater good and her oaths to Atris before herself, forsaking her name and identity. It was not until she finally defeated her sisters in combat and confronted Atris that Brianna fully gained a sense of self-worth, finally embracing her name as a result, and casting aside the shame of her parentage. She believed combat to be one of the purest ways of expressing oneself, and that a person\\'s fighting style accurately displayed what kind of person they were.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBrianna was steadfastly loyal to her superiors, and was completely devoted to Atris before Meetra Surik earned her trust. She was initially very slow to trust Surik due to the warnings Atris had given, but Surik\\'s kindness, as well as Brianna\\'s reading of her through combat caused her to eventually open up. When Surik saved her life, Brianna completely renounced her ties to Atris. Her trust did not extend to Surik\\'s other companions, however, and she remained wary of both Kreia and Marr for the extent of their journey.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nIn addition, despite being criticized by her sisters for her passion, Brianna was typically very reserved and did not interact much with the crew, choosing to seclude herself in the cargo bay instead. Despite this, her irritation with her fellow crew members occasionally showed, typically with Rand and Marr. She expressed her passion through combat, and developed a yearning to feel the Force, eventually receiving Jedi training from the Exile. This curiosity stemmed from her having examined some of Atris\\'s [[Holocron/Legends|Jedi holocrons]], and her interest in these artifacts may have led to her taking the position of Jedi historian as Kreia predicted.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nHaving lived a relatively sheltered life in the secret academy on Telos, Brianna displayed some naïveté towards the workings of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], a fact commented on by Atton Rand. She also failed to grasp jokes made by Surik and the bounty hunter [[Mira]], as well as Rand\\'s sarcasm. Brianna tended to view things in terms of black and white, and argued with Surik over some of her decisions, feeling that any act of questionable morality was unacceptable, a mindset she likely developed from following Atris\\' own strict beliefs.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{Quote|She has always brought shame upon us.

Brianna found her training to be helpful in maintaining her focus, and trained often while traveling with Surik, particularly when annoyed by Surik\\'s other companions. In addition, Brianna was skilled in the use of [[Precognition/Legends|Battle Precognition]], which allowed her to perceive her opponents\\' intentions an instant before they acted, giving her an edge in combat. She recognized Surik\\'s potential with precognition and taught her to use the ability as well. Her combat prowess extended to numerous weapons including [[Force pike/Legends|Force pikes]] and blasters. Brianna also utilized a unique [[Handmaiden\\'s staff|staff]] that possessed qualities similar to a [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|saberstaff]], and was given to her by her father. Along with her various weapons, Brianna could also fight effectively unarmed due to her proficiency in Echani.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAs the daughter of a Jedi, Arren Kae, Brianna was Force-sensitive and eventually accepted Jedi training from Surik, becoming a Jedi Guardian. As a Jedi Guardian, Brianna focused on combat and learned the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] techniques and abilities of the Jedi, supplementing her skills with powers such as [[Force Jump]]. With Jedi training, her combat proficiency increased to the point where she surpassed even her sisters in skill and managed to defeat all of them together in combat. Brianna was even able to duel evenly against Jedi Master Atris for a while before being overwhelmed by Force Lightning. She also displayed significant endurance, and was able to stand after being battered by Force Lightning and seemed relatively steady despite the ordeal.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Equipment==\\nBrianna possessed many items she was given by her parents, including Jedi robes from her mother and staff from her father. The Jedi robe inherited from her mother, Arren Kae, was light-grey in color. It also provided her some improvements and protection.

This inconsistency can most likely be attributed to the [[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']] being written from an [[in-universe]] point of view, with the [[New Jedi Order]]\\'s records on the battle being inaccurate.

There is a glitch in the game which allows a male Surik to accidentally kill Brianna during her training. Upon opening the character selection screen, her space will have no picture, and the name will be replaced by the words \"I am so very very broken.\" Should the player attempt to speak to Brianna when Surik has more influence with Visas than Brianna, she will get upset and refuse to speak to him for the remainder of the game.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Dark side ending===\\n[[File:Briannadsportrait.jpg|thumb|right|Brianna with [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] alignment]]\\nDue to Meetra Surik\\'s unique ability to form close bonds with her companions and even twist their motivations to her will, Brianna can be influenced to fall to the dark side. If Brianna joins Surik and then falls to the dark side, Kreia predicts that she will stop looking up to the Jedi and give herself over to battle completely. She abandons her Force training and instead will punish the Jedi for being too emotional. Should Brianna fall to the dark side and become a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] Guardian, she also replaces her pure white clothing with a similar looking garment that is completely black and fastened with leather.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Playing as a male Surik====\\n{{Quote|I wish to see what the Handmaiden sees when she looks at you that causes her heart to race, and her tone to change.|Visas Marr|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nAlthough it was confirmed to be [[canon]] that Brianna accompanied Surik during her travels,<ref name=\"KOTOR minis preview 5\" /><ref name=\"Tasty Taste answer\" /> in the game itself, she would only accompany Surik if the player was male. Otherwise, she would be replaced by [[Mical]]. At some point Surik asked Brianna to teach her Echani fighting techniques, and over the course of their journey they sparred three times, each time learning more about each other and became closer, to the point that both Atton and Kreia would notice and comment on it.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nThe main difference in Brianna\\'s journey with a male Surik would be her development of romantic feelings towards Surik, as well as her rivalry with Visas for his affections. When Visas is first accepted into the group by Surik, Brianna challenges his choice, feeling that Visas could betray them to the Sith, and also displayed jealousy at Surik\\'s willingness to accept another woman so easily. If Surik had higher influence with Visas than Brianna, she would confront the Miraluka in jealousy, accusing her of planning to betray them to the Sith, and ignoring the latter\\'s attempts to placate her. Brianna\\'s envy would grow to the point where Kreia would take advantage of it, manipulating the handmaiden\\'s feelings and convincing her to be ready to confront Visas when Kreia felt the time was right.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nWith a male Surik, Brianna would also take Kreia to Atris, with her grief over Surik\\'s death clouding her judgment. She would confront her sisters, as well as Atris, who would eventually use Force lightning. Brianna was unprepared and thrown to her knees after one hit, but Atris tortured her with another round of lightning, her jealousy burning over Brianna\\'s closeness to Surik and accusing her of falling in love with him as Brianna laid writhing in agony. Rendered hurt and helpless, it seemed Atris was going to finish her off, when suddenly Surik appeared at the last second, and challenged Atris to a duel. Only further angered by Surik\\'s display of concern, she struck Brianna one last time with lightning and, leaving her for dead on the floor, retreated to her chamber to do battle with Surik.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAfter Surik dueled with Atris, Brianna surprisingly managed to survive the vicious assault, and now without the oath to her sisters or her mistress to hold her there, she once again pledged herself to Surik in gratitude. This time she would never let the stigma of her family hold her back from following her heart again. She renounced her title as Last of the Handmaidens, and accepted her true identity for the first time, as well as her name (which up to this point, she had kept secret even from Surik).<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n===Cut content===\\n[[File:Briannaportrait.jpg|thumb|right|Brianna\\'s portrait]]\\n{{Main|Cut content from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nIn an earlier version of the game, Brianna was originally meant to join Meetra Surik regardless of gender, so long as Surik was light-sided (dark sided players would have been joined by Visas Marr instead).<ref name=\"Gizka1\">{{Cite_web|url=http://forums.team-gizka.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1961&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&sid=e4aeb77a3bf178fb590cf9e39dee3e01|title=Team Gizka :: View topic - What was cut? *MAJOR SPOILAGE*, page 1|nobackup=1}} {{C|Now defunct}}</ref>\\n\\nBrianna was intended to fight her sisters in the Telos Academy, either to kill them or to stun them, letting them live.<ref name=\"Gizka1\" /> In the official release, when her sisters act hostile and it appears a fight is about to begin, the scene instead fades to black, fading back in later to show all the handmaidens save Brianna prone on the ground.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nBrianna had a couple of scenes that were eventually cut out of the game: If the player had more influence with Visas Marr than the Handmaiden, or the PC was dark-sided, then Brianna would attack Marr in the [[Trayus Academy]] on [[Malachor V]], accusing her of seducing Surik.

She was deeply committed to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Order]] and was a fierce adherent of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]]. But Atris\\' faith in the righteousness of the Jedi wavered when her personal hero, [[Meetra Surik]], turned her back on the Council to join rogue Knights [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]] and their [[Revanchist|faction]] of Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. Atris chose not to go to war, but this decision left her bitter and conflicted.\\n\\nWhen Surik returned to face the Council\\'s judgment after the devastating events of the [[Battle of Malachor V]], Atris was the first to condemn her, suggesting that she had fallen to the dark side just as Revan had. Over time, Atris grew to hate Surik for complicating her black-and-white view of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. During the [[Dark Wars]], Atris called a secret Jedi [[Conclave at Katarr|convocation]] on the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] world of [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]] in an attempt to find the threat that was stalking the Jedi. She then leaked knowledge of the conclave\\'s existence in the hopes of drawing out the Sith. She succeeded, but with dire consequences; [[Darth Nihilus]] devastated the surface of the planet, wiping out all life on Katarr, including the Jedi gathered there.\\n\\nHowever, Atris survived, and she remained in seclusion, surrounding herself with [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] [[Handmaiden Sisters|Handmaidens]] who could not feel the Force. She planned to rebuild the Jedi Order, and established a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]] in the old irrigation system on [[Telos IV]]. However, she was heavily influenced by the many [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]] she had collected in her efforts to find and understand the Sith. The holocrons fed her bitterness, and she slowly and quietly fell to the dark side, consequently becoming the new \\'\\'\\'Darth Traya\\'\\'\\', the \\'\\'\\'Queen of Betrayal\\'\\'\\'. Per the machinations of her mentor, [[Kreia]], Surik and the new [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Traya confronted each other once more on Telos, where Surik convinced Atris to turn away from the dark side. Atris then remained in the Jedi Academy, waiting to be judged for her actions by the new Jedi Council.\\n\\n==Biography==\\n===Early life===\\n[[File:Atrisart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Atris, austere custodian of the Jedi Order]]\\nAfter the [[3996 BBY|end]] of the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]] that was started by the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] and [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], the Jedi historian Atris attempted to revise the broken system of Jedi apprenticeship. She argued that there was little wonder why Kun and Qel-Droma fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], when the Jedi had liberal instruction practices in place, such as dozens of [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] training under a single Master, the radical bonds of reciprocal apprenticeship, and Jedi beginning their training in their teens and later. She invoked thousand-year old recommendations first suggested by the Jedi Master [[Simikarty]], lobbying for the restriction of Padawans that a Master could have at one time, and also limiting the age of Jedi candidates.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\\n\\nAtris also advocated prohibiting romantic involvement for Jedi, citing that the [[First Great Schism]] had been started by two lovers. She even endorsed adoption of a more austere interpretation of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] which was favored by the [[Draethos (species)|Draethos]] Jedi Master [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]], in memory of his death at the hands of Exar Kun at the Jedi Academy on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. Her arguments found powerful purchase amongst the Jedi, and she was appointed to High Council.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\\n\\n===The Mandalorian Wars===\\n{{Quote|We all have our heroes.

However, Atris resisted the call to protect the inhabitants of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], instead staunchly defending the council\\'s decision to meditate and reflect before taking action.<ref name=\"FMWA\">\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', Exile\\'s first visit to the Telosian Jedi Academy.</ref>\\n[[File:Council1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Atris, sitting on the Jedi High Council in [[3963 BBY]].]]\\nMany Jedi did not understand how the Council could sit idly while innocents died, and the order was split when two [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] named [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]] chose to go to war. Many followed them, including the Jedi [[Meetra Surik]]. Atris had held a strong admiration for Surik, viewing her as something of a hero as well as a close friend. When she and Revan left the Order to join the war, rejecting everything that Atris believed in, Atris felt personally betrayed.<ref name=\"FMWA\" /> Atris condemned Revan, his followers, and the \"freethinking\" teachings of his former Jedi Master, fellow historian [[Kreia]]. Revan\\'s eventual turn to the dark side came as little surprise to Atris.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> Indeed, when Revan met Atris years later asking what happened to Surik, Atris made little effort to conceal her contempt.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\">\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nAfter the war\\'s end, only one of the Jedi who had followed Revan to war [[Trial of Meetra Surik|returned to face the council]]: Meetra Surik.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> She stood before them as an echo in the Force, having cut herself off from it after the final battle at [[Malachor V]]. Surik was so defiant, so certain of the rightness of her actions that she caused Atris to doubt herself. Atris wanted to punish Surik for this, and became convinced that she had fallen to the dark side along with all of the others who had followed Revan. She felt that exile was too lenient of a punishment for Surik\\'s betrayal, and believed that she would only join Revan again if she was free. The other Masters warned her to be mindful of her feelings, but Atris insisted that Surik ought to have died at Malachor V, because when she stood before them, it was if she was already dead. The Council decided not to tell Surik that she had become a [[wound in the Force]], which was the result of her actions at Malachor.<ref name=\"FMWA\" />\\n\\nAtris kept [[Meetra Surik\\'s first lightsaber|Surik\\'s lightsaber]] after the trial, carrying it with her always. Even many years later, she insisted that the Council was right to be cautious.

He accessed the file on Surik and found it lacking in information about her whereabouts. Behind him, Atris spoke out, during their conversation she revealed that Surik had disconnected herself from the Force because of the guilt she carried over her actions during the Mandalorian Wars. Although Revan felt responsible for Surik\\'s fate, he refused to give her the satisfaction of seeing his guilt and grief. She stormed out of the room.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\" />\\n\\n===The Dark Wars===\\n{{Quote|It is such a quiet thing, to fall.

To make matters worse, some \\'\\'thing\\'\\' was systematically hunting and killing what Jedi there were left. Atris rallied a secret [[Conclave at Katarr|Jedi convocation]] on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]], a colony world of the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]], where the threat could be assessed and the future of the Order discussed.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> However, Atris leaked knowledge of the session in hopes of drawing out this threat so that it could be fought. Unfortunately, she greatly underestimated its strength. The Sith arrived in the form of [[Darth Nihilus]], who proved to be too powerful for the Jedi. Through the Force, he devoured all life on the planet, including the Jedi and Miraluka (with the single exception of [[Visas Marr]], whom he later took as his apprentice). Atris, having not attended the Conclave, survived, along with a handful of other Masters who went into hiding.<ref name=\"CotOR\">\\'\\'[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nAtris took refuge under a polar ice cap on the planet [[Telos IV]], where she began to build a secret [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi academy]] in an old irrigation system. Here she hid most of the Jedi\\'s most valuable artifacts and resources, including many Sith holocrons.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nShe sought to remedy what she saw as a fundamental flaw of the Jedi Order: the lack of any mechanism to prevent Jedi from falling to the dark side, and repeatedly wreaking havoc on [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. To that end, she trained [[Handmaiden Sisters|a group of half-sisters]], specially equipped and trained to resist [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] and, if necessary, use their [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] combat skills to subdue wayward Jedi. Atris planned to eventually rebuild the Jedi Order, but she greatly overestimated her own ability to resist the dark side, becoming corrupted by delving into the forbidden knowledge of her collection of Sith holocrons.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Reunion with Meetra Surik====\\n{{Quote|I did not expect to see you again after the day of your sentencing. I thought you had taken the exile\\'s path, wandering the galaxy. Yet you have returned - why?|Atris, to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nIn [[3951 BBY]], Meetra Surik and her companions landed on Telos IV, having narrowly escaped the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction]] of the [[Peragus Mining Facility]] at [[Peragus II]]. Upon hearing that the [[Telos Security Force]] held an individual called the Jedi Exile and her party under house arrest for their suspected involvement in the explosion of the mining facility, Atris desired to uncover the cause of the explosion, knowing that the consequences of its loss would be tremendous. Therefore, she sent one of her Handmaidens by the name of [[Brianna]], to steal their ship, the \\'\\'[[Ebon Hawk]]\\'\\', as well as [[T3-M4]] who, fortunately for her, was on board. The ship and droid were dissected for information, though little of value was actually found.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n[[File:Atristrial.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A holorecord of Atris at the Jedi Exile\\'s trial.]]\\nUpon discovering the loss of her ship, Surik managed to [[Skirmish on Telos|trace]] the \\'\\'Ebon Hawk\\'\\' to the polar plateau where Atris\\'s academy was hidden. Once she found her way inside, Atris had Surik\\'s companions placed in [[force cage]]s while the Handmaidens brought Meetra Surik before her to be questioned. Not long before this, Atris had discovered Surik\\'s identity, and was surprised at the revelation&mdash;she had not expected to see her again after the Council sentenced her to Exile.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAt first she hoped that Surik had returned to admit that the Council had been right and to face up to her crimes, but that was not the case. Surik\\'s presence stirred unpleasant feelings which Atris had all but forgotten, and hoped lost. These feelings showed themselves when she accused Meetra Surik of walking the dark path, when Atris\\' words were the ones that sounded bitter and resentful. In fact, she was so angry about what Surik did that she refused to believe that Surik had meant to help others in the Mandalorian Wars, and said she simply went off for the adventure and the excitement of battle. Atris continued to berate Surik by blaming her for the destruction of Peragus II. She was shocked to learn the Sith were behind it, and even more shocked when she learned the Sith were hunting Meetra Surik. She reluctantly accepted Surik\\'s offer of help in defeating them, and instructed her to gather other Jedi on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] so that action could be taken and a Council could be had.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nAfter departing Telos IV, Surik discovered that T3-M4 had downloaded Atris\\'s archives. It seemed that Atris had kept a holo record of her trial, as well as a list of the remaining [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]&mdash;despite her claim that she was the \"last of the Jedi\" because T3 had been able to slice into the historian\\'s files and copy them, locating the Jedi Masters for Atris\\'s proposed meeting proved easier.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n====Admission and letting go====\\nAs Atris sought desperately to understand Surik\\'s motives, which was part of the reason for her keeping of the [[Holocron/Legends|holocrons]], she clung even more desperately to her perfect view of the Jedi. However, in light of Surik\\'s choices, she knew that either she or the Council was wrong. Though she placed Surik in the wrong, it only made her more unsettled, as, inwardly, she respected her choice. It built up a pressure that finally exploded when Kreia, who had then revealed her former identity as Darth Traya after she had killed the three Council members [[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Kavar]], and [[Vrook Lamar]] when they reconvened on Dantooine, stripped Atris of her self-denials and allowed her to finally accepting that she was betrayed by her dark persona; Atris embraced herself as Darth Traya,<ref name=\"Admission\">\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', When Kreia speaks to Atris while in her meditation chamber.</ref> the Queen of Betrayal,<ref name=\"TSLOSG\">\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]\\'\\'</ref> and was told by Kreia that Meetra Surik would return to her sanctum on Telos to confront her for the last time.<ref name=\"Admission\" />\\n\\nAfter being informed by an Onderonian colonel named [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] of the Jedi academy on Telos, who had been in turn informed by Kreia, Darth Nihilus attacked Telos, believing that he could feed on what Jedi were there.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nWhen Surik, who was searching for Kreia after having been left by the former Sith, returned to the Academy, Darth Traya [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|clashed]] with her in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]], and was defeated. Surik, however, spared her life. This action was something Traya believed Meetra Surik would never have done. However, it led her to forgo the moniker of Darth Traya and for Atris to chose to let go of the Jedi; to be exiled from the Order to find her human self once more.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Atris was held captive in her sanctum until judged by [[Mical]] and the new Jedi Council; the disciples of Meetra Surik.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\n[[File:Atris_KotORCG.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Atris, Jedi Master and Historian.]]\\nAtris was extremely dedicated to the Jedi Order, and believed in their righteousness to the point of arrogance and fanaticism. She was impatient with dissenters, and took accusations against the Jedi very personally. When many Jedi left the order to follow Revan to war, Atris was eager to write them all off as traitors and Sith, even Meetra Surik after she returned to face the Council.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nDuring the Dark Wars, Atris became reclusive, and obsessed with preserving what she could of the Jedi legacy, including the Sith relics which would ultimately lead her down the path to the dark side. She was bitter and untrusting, surrounding herself with Echani warriors trained to resist the Force. Though she claimed to be building a Jedi Academy, she made no efforts to bring Force-sensitives to train. In fact, despite knowing the locations of the Jedi Masters Zez-Kai Ell, Vrook Lamar, Kavar, and [[Lonna Vash]], she made no attempt to contact them, and none of them knew that she was still alive.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\nIt was ironic that despite the fact that Atris championed various causes, such as the limitation of the amount of Padawans a single Master could have,<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> or the fact that she attempted to preserve Jedi knowledge,<ref name=\"TSL\" /> she herself never took a Padawan.<ref>\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\', When Meetra Surik talks to one of the Handmaidens that is not Brianna, that handmaiden mentions this fact.</ref>\\n\\nAtris wore an all-white variation of the traditional robes of a Jedi historian.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{Quote|All this collected knowledge, all these teachings of combat and the Force - they are mine to command.|Atris to the Jedi Exile|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\\nAtris was a very powerful Jedi Master, using powers such as [[Force suppression]], [[Ionize|Droid Disable]], and [[Force Stun|Force stun]].

This party member would then figure out that both Atris and Kreia had been corrupted by the dark side.\\n\\n[[File:Atrisportrait.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Atris\\'s portrait from the game files.]]\\nCut content from her dialog with Kreia indicates that Atris\\'s fall involved Kreia making references to Telos, and how twice the choices of the Jedi had marked the planet for destruction, first by Revan as Telos was to host the Jedi and their lore in the avenue of a sudden attack, then by Darth Nihilus because Atris chose to hide there.\\n\\nDuring Atris\\' battle with the Exile, at some point, she would use the Exile\\'s first lightsaber against her, claiming it is not hers to wield anymore.\\n\\nOriginally, the light side and dark side endings differed from each other more significantly than in the final game. One possible ending featured Kreia\\'s redemption and Atris\\'s total shift to the dark side, which culminated in the scene where Atris attacked the player wearing a black robe and claimed that she, not Kreia, was Darth Traya. Her dark side model remained in the PC version of the game and can appear in the main menu if the CurSithLord option is set to 1 in swkotor2.ini. An [[Wikipedia:Datel Action Replay|Action Replay]] mod is needed to view it on the Xbox. You may also use the model in the KOTOR/TSL Save Game Editor. If the KOTOR Save Editor is used, the code for her dark side model is Unique_Darth_Traya, indicating she was meant to become the new Darth Traya.\\n\\nLater on, the dark side model of Atris (see above) was planned to be put in the final game for the confrontation with Atris, but it was removed a few weeks before the game was released, with the reason that the presence of the dark side model was confusing the game testers.\\n\\n==Appearances==\\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Atris}}\\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 9|\\'\\'Knights of the Old Republic\\'\\' 9]]\\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|\\'\\'Knights of the Old Republic\\'\\' 29]]\\n*\\'\\'[[The Old Republic: Revan]]\\'\\'\\n*[[The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)|\\'\\'The Old Republic: Revan\\'\\' audiobook]]\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]\\'\\' {{1st}}\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]\\'\\' {{Mo}}\\n*[[Cartel Market|\\'\\'Star Wars: The Old Republic\\'\\' Cartel Market]] {{C|Outfit}}\\n\\n==Sources==\\n*\\'\\'[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]\\'\\' {{1stm}}\\n*\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[The New Essential Chronology]]\\'\\' {{ID|Darth Traya}}\\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|\\'\\'Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\\'\\']]\\n*\\'\\'[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]\\'\\' {{Po}}\\n\\n==Notes and references==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n{{CouncilMandWar}}\\n\\n{{CouncilAMandWar}}\\n\\n{{Start box}}\\n{{Succession box\\n|title=[[Chief Librarian/Legends|Chief Librarian]] of the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]]\\n|years=[[3954 BBY]]&ndash;[[3951 BBY]]\\n|before=Unknown\\n|after=Eventually [[Ostar-Gal]]\\n}}\\n{{End box}}\\n\\n{{Interlang\\n|da=Atris\\n|de=Atris#legends\\n|es=Atris\\n|fr=Atris\\n|hu=Atris\\n|pl=Atris\\n|pt=Atris\\n|ru=Эйтрис\\n|deFA=1\\n}}\\n\\n[[Category:Darths]]\\n[[Category:Females]]\\n[[Category:Humans]]\\n[[Category:Jedi High Council members]]\\n[[Category:Lore Keepers]]\\n[[Category:Lost Jedi (Jedi Order)]]\\n[[Category:Redeemed Jedi]]')]"

In [[December]] [[2002]], he informed his production staff that Princess Leia\\'s surrogate mother would appear in the movie. Lucas described her as a trustworthy, peaceful woman in her mid-thirties, and illustrator [[Iain McCaig]] drew several conceptual artworks based on that description. In one of his drawings, McGaig gave Breha the traits of Padmé Amidala, in an attempt to explain how Leia could remember seeing the smile of her mother.

When her brothers helped her understand that the Queen was none other than the adopted mother of Princess Leia, her excitement over the role increased. Rebecca Jackson Mendoza remembered having watched the original trilogy as a child, wishing she could be Princess Leia. In light of all that, Jackson Mendoza came to regard that role as something of an accomplishment.<ref name=\"Beacon\">{{SWArchive|url=episode-iii/bts/production/beacon161.html|text=Homing Beacon #161 - Revenge\\'s Royalty|archivedate=20061201041244}} Royalty}}</ref>\\n\\nA single robe, referred to as the \"Alderaan Palace Dress\" in \\'\\'[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]\\'\\',<ref name=\"DAG\">\\'\\'[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]\\'\\'</ref> was created for Jackson Mendoza by [[Trisha Biggar]], who worked as costume designer for all three prequel films.
