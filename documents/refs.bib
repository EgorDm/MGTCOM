  abstract = {Graph embedding methods represent nodes in a continuous vector space, preserving different types of relational information from the graph. There are many hyper-parameters to these methods (e.g. the length of a random walk) which have to be manually tuned for every graph. In this paper, we replace previously fixed hyper-parameters with trainable ones that we automatically learn via backpropagation. In particular, we propose a novel attention model on the power series of the transition matrix, which guides the random walk to optimize an upstream objective. Unlike previous approaches to attention models, the method that we propose utilizes attention parameters exclusively on the data itself (e.g. on the random walk), and are not used by the model for inference. We experiment on link prediction tasks, as we aim to produce embeddings that best-preserve the graph structure, generalizing to unseen information. We improve state-of-the-art results on a comprehensive suite of real-world graph datasets including social, collaboration, and biological networks, where we observe that our graph attention model can reduce the error by up to 20\%-40\%. We show that our automatically-learned attention parameters can vary significantly per graph, and correspond to the optimal choice of hyper-parameter if we manually tune existing methods.},

In this research, we are exploring the possibility of using deep learning in community detection among the graph datasets. Graphs have gained growing traction in different fields, including social networks, information graphs, the recommender system, and also life sciences. In this paper, we propose a method of community detection clustering the nodes of various graph datasets. We cluster different category datasets that belong to affiliation networks, animal networks, human contact networks, human social networks, miscellaneous networks. The deep learning role in modeling the interaction between nodes in a network allows a revolution in the field of science relevant to graph network analysis. In this paper, we extend the gumbel softmax approach to graph network clustering. The experimental findings on specific graph datasets reveal that the new approach outperforms traditional clustering significantly, which strongly shows the efficacy of deep learning in graph community detection clustering. We do a series of experiments on our graph clustering algorithm, using various graph datasets: Zachary's karate club, Highland tribes, Train bombing, American Revolution, Dolphins, Zebra, Windsurfers, Les Mis\'erables, Political books.},

It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only `traditional ' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

The study of the evolution of these graphs over time can provide tremendous insight on the behavior of entities, communities and the flow of information among them. In this work, we present an event-based characterization of critical behavioral patterns for temporally varying interaction graphs. We use nonoverlapping snapshots of interaction graphs and develop a framework for capturing and identifying interesting events from them. We use these events to characterize complex behavioral patterns of individuals and communities over time. We show how semantic information can be incorporated to reason about community-behavior events. We also demonstrate the application of behavioral patterns for the purposes of modeling evolution, link prediction and influence maximization. Finally, we present a diffusion model for evolving networks, based on our framework.},

They can usually be divided in dense sub-graphs with few links between them, called communities and detecting this un-derlying community structure may have a major impact in the understanding of these systems. We focus here on evolving graphs, for which the usual approach is to represent the state of the system at different time steps and to compute communities independently on the graph obtained at each time step.  We propose in this paper to use a different framework: instead of detecting communities on each time step, we detect a unique decomposition in communities that is relevant for (almost) every time step during a given period called the time window. We propose a definition of this new decomposition and two algorithms to detect it quickly. We validate both the approach and the algorithms on three evolving networks of different kinds showing that the quality loss at each time step is very low despite the constraint of maximization on several time steps. Since the time window length is a crucial parameter of our technique, we also propose an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to build automatically a hierarchical time segmentation into time windows. This clustering relies on a new similarity measure based on community structure. We show that it is very efficient in detecting meaningful windows.},

  abstract = {Social media data has become crucial to the advancement of scientific understanding. However, even though it has become ubiquitous, just collecting large-scale social media data involves a high degree of engineering skill set and computational resources. In fact, research is often times gated by data engineering problems that must be overcome before analysis can proceed. This has resulted recognition of datasets as meaningful research contributions in and of themselves. Reddit, the so called "front page of the Internet," in particular has been the subject of numerous scientific studies. Although Reddit is relatively open to data acquisition compared to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the technical barriers to acquisition still remain. Thus, Reddit's millions of subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and hundreds of billions of comments are at the same time relatively accessible, but time consuming to collect and analyze systematically. In this paper, we present the Pushshift Reddit dataset. Pushshift is a social media data collection, analysis, and archiving platform that since 2015 has collected Reddit data and made it available to researchers. Pushshift's Reddit dataset is updated in real-time, and includes historical data back to Reddit's inception. In addition to monthly dumps, Pushshift provides computational tools to aid in searching, aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the entirety of the dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes it possible for social media researchers to reduce time spent in the data collection, cleaning, and storage phases of their projects.},

  abstract = {Multilayer networks allow one to represent diverse and coupled connectivity patterns --- e.g., time-dependence, multiple subsystems, or both --- that arise in many applications and which are difficult or awkward to incorporate into standard network representations. In the study of multilayer networks, it is important to investigate mesoscale (i.e., intermediate-scale) structures, such as dense sets of nodes known as communities, to discover network features that are not apparent at the microscale or the macroscale. The ill-defined nature of mesoscale structure and its ubiquity in empirical networks make it crucial to develop generative models that can produce the features that one encounters in empirical networks. Key purposes of such generative models include generating synthetic networks with empirical properties of interest, benchmarking mesoscale-detection methods and algorithms, and inferring structure in empirical multilayer networks. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the construction of generative models for mesoscale structures in multilayer networks. Our framework provides a standardized set of generative models, together with an associated set of principles from which they are derived, for studies of mesoscale structures in multilayer networks. It unifies and generalizes many existing models for mesoscale structures in fully-ordered (e.g., temporal) and unordered (e.g., multiplex) multilayer networks. One can also use it to construct generative models for mesoscale structures in partially-ordered multilayer networks (e.g., networks that are both temporal and multiplex). Our framework has the ability to produce many features of empirical multilayer networks, and it explicitly incorporates a user-specified dependency structure between layers.},

Empirically, we combine survey data on 135 inventors working in a German high-tech firm with information derived from the firm's 1031 patents. Results from multilevel exponential random graph models (ERGM) show that different dimensions of knowledge derived from the firm's knowledge network shape the transfer of advice among inventors in unique ways. Thus, our study demonstrates how structural features of the firm's knowledge stock influence interpersonal interactions among its inventors thereby affecting the intra-organizational diffusion of knowledge and the recombinant possibilities of the firm.},

We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a framework on multiple real-world datasets, and show that it improves graph visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.},

Music consumption is biased towards a few popular artists. For instance, in 2007 only 1\% of all digital tracks accounted for 80\% of all sales. Similarly, 1,000 albums accounted for 50\% of all album sales, and 80\% of all albums sold were purchased less than 100 times. There is a need to assist people to filter, discover, personalise and recommend from the huge amount of music content available along the Long Tail. Current music recommendation algorithms try to accurately predict what people demand to listen to. However, quite often these algorithms tend to recommend popular \textemdash or well\textendash known to the user\textemdash{} music, decreasing the effectiveness of the recommendations. These approaches focus on improving the accuracy of the recommendations. That is, try to make accurate predictions about what a user could listen to, or buy next, independently of how useful to the user could be the provided recommendations. In this Thesis we stress the importance of the user's perceived quality of the recommendations. We model the Long Tail curve of artist popularity to predict \textemdash potentially\textemdash{} interesting and unknown music, hidden in the tail of the popularity curve. Effective recommendation systems should promote novel and relevant material (non\textendash obvious recommendations), taken primarily from the tail of a popularity distribution. The main contributions of this Thesis are: (i) a novel network\textendash based approach for recommender systems, based on the analysis of the item (or user) similarity graph, and the popularity of the items, (ii) a user\textendash centric evaluation that measures the user's relevance and novelty of the recommendations, and (iii) two prototype systems that implement the ideas derived from the theoretical work.

In this work, we argue that, instead of developing separate approaches for detecting overlapping communities, a promising alternative is to infer the overlapping communities from multiple disjoint community structures. We propose an ensemble-based approach, called EnCoD, that leverages the solutions produced by various disjoint community detection algorithms to discover the overlapping community structure. Specifically, EnCoD~generates a feature vector for each vertex from the results of the base algorithms and learns which features lead to detect densely connected overlapping regions in an unsupervised way. It keeps on iterating until the likelihood of each vertex belonging to its own community maximizes. Experiments on both synthetic and several real-world networks (with known ground-truth community structures) reveal that EnCoD~significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art overlapping community detection algorithms Finally, we show that EnCoD~is generic enough to be applied to networks where the vertices are associated with explicit semantic features. To the best of our knowledge, EnCoD~is the second ensemble-based overlapping community detection approach after MEDOC Chakraborty (2016).},

  abstract = {Many real-world networks are intimately organized according to a community structure. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms that can efficiently highlight this hidden structure of a network, yielding a vast literature on what is called today community detection. Since network representation can be very complex and can contain different variants in the traditional graph model, each algorithm in the literature focuses on some of these properties and establishes, explicitly or implicitly, its own definition of community. According to this definition, each proposed algorithm then extracts the communities, which typically reflect only part of the features of real communities. The aim of this survey is to provide a `user manual' for the community discovery problem. Given a meta definition of what a community in a social network is, our aim is to organize the main categories of community discovery methods based on the definition of community they adopt. Given a desired definition of community and the features of a problem (size of network, direction of edges, multidimensionality, and so on) this review paper is designed to provide a set of approaches that researchers could focus on. The proposed classification of community discovery methods is also useful for putting into perspective the many open directions for further research. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This problem is of crucial importance in the field of social network analysis. The goal of our paper is to classify existing methods dealing with the issue. We propose a classification of various methods for tracking community evolution in dynamic social networks into four main approaches using as a criterion the functioning principle: the first one is based on independent successive static detection and matching; the second is based on dependent successive static detection; the third is based on simultaneous study of all stages of community evolution; finally, the fourth and last one concerns methods working directly on temporal networks. Our paper starts by giving basic concepts about social networks, community structure and strategies for evaluating community detection methods. Then, it describes the different approaches, and exposes the strengths as well as the weaknesses of each.},

Most of the existing KG embedding methods ignore this temporal dimension while learning embeddings of the KG elements. In this paper, we propose HyTE, a temporally aware KG embedding method which explicitly incorporates time in the entity-relation space by associating each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane. HyTE not only performs KG inference using temporal guidance, but also predicts temporal scopes for relational facts with missing time annotations. Through extensive experimentation on temporal datasets extracted from real-world KGs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over both traditional as well as temporal KG embedding methods.},

We propose a supervised ranking approach to the prob- lem and assess its performance on a manager-subordinate re- lationship identification task using the Enron email corpus.

  abstract = {The discovery of evolving communities in dynamic networks is an important research topic that poses challenging tasks. Evolutionary clustering is a recent framework for clustering dynamic networks that introduces the concept of temporal smoothness inside the community structure detection method. Evolutionary-based clustering approaches try to maximize cluster accuracy with respect to incoming data of the current time step, and minimize clustering drift from one time step to the successive one. In order to optimize both these two competing objectives, an input parameter that controls the preference degree of a user towards either the snapshot quality or the temporal quality is needed. In this paper the detection of communities with temporal smoothness is formulated as a multiobjective problem and a method based on genetic algorithms is proposed. The main advantage of the algorithm is that it automatically provides a solution representing the best trade-off between the accuracy of the clustering obtained, and the deviation from one time step to the successive. Experiments on synthetic data sets show the very good performance of the method when compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

In many applications, the edges of a dynamic network might not be observed, but one can observe the dynamics of stochastic cascading processes (e.g., information diffusion, virus propagation) occurring over the unobserved network. While there have been efforts to infer networks based on such data, providing a generative probabilistic model that is able to identify the underlying time-varying network remains an open question. Here we consider the problem of inferring generative dynamic network models based on network cascade diffusion data. We propose a novel framework for providing a non-parametric dynamic network model\textemdash based on a mixture of coupled hierarchical Dirichlet processes\textemdash{} based on data capturing cascade node infection times. Our approach allows us to infer the evolving community structure in networks and to obtain an explicit predictive distribution over the edges of the underlying network\textemdash including those that were not involved in transmission of any cascade, or are likely to appear in the future.

While a number of methods have been proposed in the machine learning and physics literature, we lack a theoretical analysis of their strengths and weaknesses, or of the ultimate limits on when communities can be detected. Here, we study the fundamental limits of detecting community structure in dynamic networks. Specifically, we analyze the limits of detectability for a dynamic stochastic block model where nodes change their community memberships over time, but where edges are generated independently at each time step. Using the cavity method, we derive a precise detectability threshold as a function of the rate of change and the strength of the communities. Below this sharp threshold, we claim that no efficient algorithm can identify the communities better than chance. We then give two algorithms that are optimal in the sense that they succeed all the way down to this threshold. The first uses belief propagation, which gives asymptotically optimal accuracy, and the second is a fast spectral clustering algorithm, based on linearizing the belief propagation equations. These results extend our understanding of the limits of community detection in an important direction, and introduce new mathematical tools for similar extensions to networks with other types of auxiliary information.},

We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability.

This analysis can be done in two ways: considering each snapshot as an independent community detection problem or taking into account the whole evolution of the network. In the first case, one can apply static methods on the temporal snapshots, which correspond to configurations of the system in short time windows, and match afterward the communities across layers. Alternatively, one can develop dedicated dynamic procedures so that multiple snapshots are simultaneously taken into account while detecting communities, which allows us to keep memory of the flow. To check how well a method of any kind could capture the evolution of communities, suitable benchmarks are needed. Here we propose a model for generating simple dynamic benchmark graphs, based on stochastic block models. In them, the time evolution consists of a periodic oscillation of the system's structure between configurations with built-in community structure. We also propose the extension of quality comparison indices to the dynamic scenario.},

Here we describe a model for tracking the progress of communities over time in a dynamic network, where each community is characterised by a series of significant evolutionary events. This model is used to motivate a community-matching strategy for efficiently identifying and tracking dynamic communities. Evaluations on synthetic graphs containing embedded events demonstrate that this strategy can successfully track communities over time in volatile networks. In addition, we describe experiments exploring the dynamic communities detected in a real mobile operator network containing millions of users.},

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

The Semantic Web is an ecosystem of data, where value is created by the integration of structured data from many sources. What applications can best synthesize the strengths of these two approaches, to create a new level of value that is both rich with human participation and powered by well-structured information? This paper proposes a class of applications called collective knowledge systems, which unlock the ``collective intelligence'' of the Social Web with knowledge representation and reasoning techniques of the Semantic Web.},

Among state-of-the-art methods, incremental algorithms based on modularity have been used widely, for the fully utilization of both current and historical information. Unfortunately, they are difficult to uncover small community due to problem called ``resolution limit'' and also sensitive to the sequence of network increments' arrival. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic community detection algorithm based on distance dynamics, which detects community in near-linear time. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods by replacing modularity with local interaction model. In a sense, it is assumed that increments can be treated as disturbance of network. It can be limited to a certain ``local area'' by disturbing factor. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has achieved well balance between efficiency and effectiveness both in synthetic and real world networks.},

In an effort to address these issues, this article examines the use of Twitter during the 2015\textendash 2016 Zika virus outbreak in the United States. Particular attention is paid to network structures within the Zika conversation and how different actors and communities contribute to the flow of information throughout the broader Twitter community. Public-facing organizations can benefit from a deeper understanding of the nature and structure of spontaneously occurring communities on social media as well as the types of content that they create and circulate. As such, these findings have significant implications for the development of effective social media strategies during natural disasters and public health emergencies. In particular, this analysis identifies several predominant themes communicated through Zika-related tweets as well as a number of distinct communities and influential actors. The findings suggest that respected political actors, public institutions, as well as those with valid scientific credentials can help to facilitate the flow of accurate and vital information across disparate communities.},

However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

We present an approach entitled Hybrid Recommendation Through Community Detection (HRTCD) for friend prediction with linear runtime complexity that makes full use of the characteristics of social media based on hybrid information fusion. It extracts the content topics of microblog for each participant along with the appraisal of domain-dependent user impact, builds a small-size heterogeneous network for each target user by fusing the interest similarity and social interaction between individuals, discovers all of the implicit clusters of target user via a community detection algorithm, and establishes the recommendation set consisting of a fixed number of potential friends. Experimental results on both the synthetic and real-world social networks demonstrate that our scheme provides a higher prediction rating and significantly improves the recommendation accuracy and offers much faster performance.},

In this paper, we present a novel preprocessing method for strengthening the community structure of a given graph by adding non-existent predicted intra-community edges and deleting existing predicted inter-community edges for more accurate community detection. Our preprocessing method does not require any extra information for community reinforcement nor any changes of existing algorithms for community detection. To realize our method, we propose the following three strategies: (1) predicting intra-community and inter-community edges, (2) determining the amount of edges to be added/deleted, and (3) reducing the amount of computations in predicting the type of edges. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments with various existing community detection algorithms on 11 synthetic and 6 real-world graphs. The results demonstrate that (1) our method significantly improves the accuracy up to 91\%, regardless of community detection algorithms and graphs and (2) it outperforms two state-of-the-art edge weighting-based preprocessing methods in improving the accuracy up to 105\%.},

Results show that commercial activities which depend on networks are determined by the institutional environment. For example, companies that have lower accumulated social capital (less trust among people) and are subject to more government invention depend more on social network transactions than on the market. In addition, this study shows that network transactions can provide benefits to firms, especially in weak institutional environments. Networks can reduce transaction costs by reducing information asymmetry, i.e., increased network dependence is associated with lower credit costs and lower advertising and sales costs. Networks can also reduce the effect of industry shocks, especially negative shocks, by creating a bonding mechanism. This study contributes to our understanding of social networks in emerging markets by providing evidence on network transactions with key suppliers and customers and their influence on firms' accounting behavior.},

WSNs can capture like/dislike, trust/distrust, and other social relationships between people. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the weights of edges in such networks. We propose two novel measures of node behavior: the goodness of a node intuitively captures how much this node is liked/trusted by other nodes, while the fairness of a node captures how fair the node is in rating other nodes' likeability or trust level. We provide axioms that these two notions need to satisfy and show that past work does not meet these requirements for WSNs. We provide a mutually recursive definition of these two concepts and prove that they converge to a unique solution in linear time. We use the two measures to predict the edge weight in WSNs. Furthermore, we show that when compared against several individual algorithms from both the signed and unsigned social network literature, our fairness and goodness metrics almost always have the best predictive power. We then use these as features in different multiple regression models and show that we can predict edge weights on 2 Bitcoin WSNs, an Epinions WSN, 2 WSNs derived from Wikipedia, and a WSN derived from Twitter with more accurate results than past work. Moreover, fairness and goodness metrics form the most significant feature for prediction in most (but not all) cases.},

A comprehensive set of user, structural, linguistic, and temporal features was examined and their relative strength was compared from near-complete date of Twitter. Our contribution is at providing deep insight into the cumulative spreading patterns of rumors over time as well as at tracking the precise changes in predictive powers across rumor features. Statistical analysis finds that structural and temporal features distinguish rumors from non-rumors over a long-term window, yet they are not available during the initial propagation phase. In contrast, user and linguistic features are readily available and act as a good indicator during the initial propagation phase. Based on these findings, we suggest a new rumor classification algorithm that achieves competitive accuracy over both short and long time windows. These findings provide new insights for explaining rumor mechanism theories and for identifying features of early rumor detection.},

Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e., the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization, and Potts model clustering. The results show that the benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.},

In this paper we extend the basic ideas behind our previous benchmark to generate directed and weighted networks with built-in community structure.

The key idea of our approach is to transform the original noisy sensor data into specific feature vectors by a series of statistical methods designed to overcome the challenges in the data. These features vectors, reflecting the interaction between people, are then clustered to reveal communities without the need to rely on localization information or pre-defined interaction models and parameters. Our data-driven approach provides robust community detection that is not sensitive to noise and missing signals, and automatically captures the dynamic interaction between people.

The aim of IM is to select a set of k users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that DISCO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. Besides, we also show that the learning model exhibits good generality.},

In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer based large-scale spectral clustering method to strike a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness. In the proposed method, a divide-and-conquer based landmark selection algorithm and a novel approximate similarity matrix approach are designed to construct a sparse similarity matrix within low computational complexities. Then clustering results can be computed quickly through a bipartite graph partition process. The proposed method achieves the lower computational complexity than most existing large-scale spectral clustering. Experimental results on ten large-scale datasets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods. The MATLAB code of the proposed method and experimental datasets are available at https://github.com/Li- Hongmin/MyPaperWithCode.},

In this paper, we propose a novel community detection algorithm for undirected graphs, called BlackHole, by importing a geometric embedding technique from graph drawing. Our proposed algorithm transforms the vertices of a graph to a set of points on a low-dimensional space whose coordinates are determined by a variant of graph drawing algorithms, following the overall procedure of spectral clustering. The set of points are then clustered using a conventional clustering algorithm to form communities. Our primary contribution is to prove that a common idea in graph drawing, which is characterized by consideration of repulsive forces in addition to attractive forces, improves the clusterability of an embedding. As a result, our algorithm has the advantages of being robust especially when the community structure is not easily detectable. Through extensive experiments, we have shown that BlackHole achieves the accuracy higher than or comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Most existing works on this problem are based on a very strict assumption that the seed node only belongs to a single community, but in real-world networks, nodes are likely to belong to multiple communities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel algorithm, HqsMLCD, that can detect multiple communities for a given seed node over static networks. HqsMLCD first finds the high-quality seeds which can detect better communities than the given seed node with the help of network representation, then expands the high-quality seeds one-by-one to get multiple communities, probably overlapping.Since dynamic networks also act an important role in practice, we extend the static HqsMLCD to handle dynamic networks and introduce HqsDMLCD. HqsDMLCD mainly integrates dynamic network embedding and dynamic local community detection into the static one. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our new method HqsMLCD outperforms the state-of-the-art multiple local community detection algorithms. And our dynamic method HqsDMLCD gets comparable results with the static method on real-world networks.},

This is a construction that strives to define the data manifold. A major obstacle to VAEs and GANs, however, is choosing a suitable prior that matches the data topology. Well-known consequences of poorly picked priors are posterior and mode collapse. To our knowledge, no existing method sidesteps this user choice. Conversely, diffusion maps automatically infer the data topology and enjoy a rigorous connection to manifold learning, but do not scale easily or provide the inverse homeomorphism (i.e. decoder/generator). We propose a method (https://github.com/lihenryhfl/vdae) that combines these approaches into a generative model that inherits the asymptotic guarantees of diffusion maps while preserving the scalability of deep models. We prove approximation theoretic results for the dimension dependence of our proposed method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with various real and synthetic datasets.},

However, especially when it comes to short text documents like Tweets, these approaches often lead to unsatisfying results due to the sparsity of the document-feature matrices. Even though, several approaches have been proposed to overcome this sparsity by taking additional information into account, these are merely focused on the aggregation of similar documents and the estimation of word-co-occurrences. This ultimately completely neglects the fact that a lot of topical-information can be actually retrieved from so-called hashtag-graphs by applying common community detection algorithms. Therefore, this paper outlines a novel approach on how to integrate topic structures of hashtag graphs into the estimation of topic models by connecting graph-based community detection and semi-supervised NMF. By applying this approach on recently streamed Twitter data it will be seen that this procedure actually leads to more intuitive and humanly interpretable topics.},

  abstract = {Community detection, aiming to group the graph nodes into clusters with dense inner-connection, is a fundamental graph mining task. Recently, it has been studied on the heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple types of nodes and edges, posing great challenges for modeling the high-order relationship between nodes. With the surge of graph embedding mechanism, it has also been adopted to community detection. A remarkable group of works use the meta-path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes and embed them into nodes' embedding to facilitate community detection. However, defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose to exploit the context path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes, and build a Context Path-based Graph Neural Network (CP-GNN) model. It recursively embeds the high-order relationship between nodes into the node embedding with attention mechanisms to discriminate the importance of different relationships. By maximizing the expectation of the co-occurrence of nodes connected by context paths, the model can learn the nodes' embeddings that both well preserve the high-order relationship between nodes and are helpful for community detection. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets show that CP-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art community detection methods1.},

Most existing network embedding methods mainly focus on static or continuous evolution patterns of microscopic node and link structures in networks, while neglecting the dynamics of macroscopic community structures. In this paper, we propose a Community-aware Dynamic Network Embedding method (short for CDNE) which considers the dynamics of macroscopic community structures. First, we model the problem of dynamic network embedding as a minimization of an overall loss function, which tries to maximally preserve the global node structures, local link structures, and continuous community dynamics. Then, we adopt a stacked deep autoencoder algorithm to solve this minimization problem, obtaining the low-dimensional representations of nodes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic networks and real networks demonstrate the superiority of CDNE over the existing methods on tackling various graph tasks.},

We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling.

For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada".

  abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental problem in many data-driven application domains, and clustering performance highly depends on the quality of data representation. Hence, linear or non-linear feature transformations have been extensively used to learn a better data representation for clustering. In recent years, a lot of works focused on using deep neural networks to learn a clustering-friendly representation, resulting in a significant increase of clustering performance. In this paper, we give a systematic survey of clustering with deep learning in views of architecture. Specifically, we first introduce the preliminary knowledge for better understanding of this field. Then, a taxonomy of clustering with deep learning is proposed and some representative methods are introduced. Finally, we propose some interesting future opportunities of clustering with deep learning and give some conclusion remarks.},

Community Detection supports and make more effective and efficient several Social Network Analysis (SNA) applications: the diffusion of a new idea or technologies can be maximized by identifying of people group interested about a given topic, the recommendation suggestion can be improved taking in account also how the social ties can be influenced the user chooses and the behaviors of people in the same communities, expert finding tasks could be more accurate if users are earlier subdivided into thematic groups, and so on. This paper presents a survey that provides a comprehensive and comparative study of all the different community detection techniques applicable to the various models proposed for OSNs. In particular, the most diffused approaches based on game theory, artificial intelligence and fuzzy strategies are detailed and compared, highlighting the related pros and cons. In addition, the problem of their applicability on the different OSN models is discussed, focusing on complex networks.

  abstract = {Most recent graph clustering methods have resorted to Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs) to perform joint clustering and embedding learning. However, two critical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted by learning with noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness and robustness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness. Second, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant similarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift. Interestingly, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has not yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) there is a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when clustering and reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the problem of Feature Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with vanilla auto-encoder models, due to the graph convolutional operation and the graph decoding design. Motivated by these findings, we reformulate the GAE-based clustering methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a sampling operator \$\textbackslash Xi\$ that triggers a protection mechanism against the noisy clustering assignments. Second, we propose an operator \$\textbackslash Upsilon\$ that triggers a correction mechanism against Feature Drift by gradually transforming the reconstructed graph into a clustering-oriented one. As principal advantages, our solution grants a considerable improvement in clustering effectiveness and robustness and can be easily tailored to existing GAE models.},

Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and dynamic network embedding approach as it achieves an average gain of 11.9\% across all methods and graphs.

With the success of these graph neural networks (GNN) in the static setting, we approach further practical scenarios where the graph dynamically evolves. Existing approaches typically resort to node embeddings and use a recurrent neural network (RNN, broadly speaking) to regulate the embeddings and learn the temporal dynamics. These methods require the knowledge of a node in the full time span (including both training and testing) and are less applicable to the frequent change of the node set. In some extreme scenarios, the node sets at different time steps may completely differ. To resolve this challenge, we propose EvolveGCN, which adapts the graph convolutional network (GCN) model along the temporal dimension without resorting to node embeddings. The proposed approach captures the dynamism of the graph sequence through using an RNN to evolve the GCN parameters. Two architectures are considered for the parameter evolution. We evaluate the proposed approach on tasks including link prediction, edge classification, and node classification. The experimental results indicate a generally higher performance of EvolveGCN compared with related approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/IBM/EvolveGCN.},

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep clustering, which is able to perform feature learning that favors clustering tasks via deep neural networks, has achieved remarkable performance in image clustering applications. However, the existing deep clustering algorithms generally need the number of clusters in advance, which is usually unknown in real-world tasks. In addition, the initial cluster centers in the learned feature space are generated by k-means. This only works well on spherical clusters and probably leads to unstable clustering results. In this paper, we propose a two-stage deep density-based image clustering (DDC) framework to address these issues. The first stage is to train a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract low-dimensional feature representations from high-dimensional image data, and then apply t-SNE to further reduce the data to a 2-dimensional space favoring density-based clustering algorithms. In the second stage, we propose a novel density-based clustering technique for the 2-dimensional embedded data to automatically recognize an appropriate number of clusters with arbitrary shapes. Concretely, a number of local clusters are generated to capture the local structures of clusters, and then are merged via their density relationship to form the final clustering result. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDC achieves comparable or even better clustering performance than state-of-the-art deep clustering methods, even though the number of clusters is not given.},

  abstract = {Evaluating a community detection algorithm is a complex task due to the lack of a shared and universally accepted definition of community. In literature, one of the most common way to assess the performances of a community detection algorithm is to compare its output with given ground truth communities by using computationally expensive metrics (i.e., Normalized Mutual Information). In this paper we propose a novel approach aimed at evaluating the adherence of a community partition to the ground truth: our methodology provides more information than the state-of-the-art ones and is fast to compute on large-scale networks. We evaluate its correctness by applying it to six popular community detection algorithms on four large-scale network datasets. Experimental results show how our approach allows to easily evaluate the obtained communities on the ground truth and to characterize the quality of community detection algorithms.},

  abstract = {(NR) is the first interactive data repository with a web-based platform for visual interactive analytics. Unlike other data repositories (e.g., UCI ML Data Repository, and SNAP), the network data repository (networkrepository.com) allows users to not only download, but to interactively analyze and visualize such data using our web-based interactive graph analytics platform. Users can in real-time analyze, visualize, compare, and explore data along many different dimensions. The aim of NR is to make it easy to discover key insights into the data extremely fast with little effort while also providing a medium for users to share data, visualizations, and insights. Other key factors that differentiate NR from the current data repositories is the number of graph datasets, their size, and variety. While other data repositories are static, they also lack a means for users to collaboratively discuss a particular dataset, corrections, or challenges with using the data for certain applications. In contrast, NR incorporates many social and collaborative aspects that facilitate scientific research, e.g., users can discuss each graph, post observations, and visualizations.},

GEMSEC places nodes in an abstract feature space where the vertex features minimize the negative log-likelihood of preserving sampled vertex neighborhoods, and it incorporates known social network properties through a machine learning regularization. We present two new social network datasets and show that by simultaneously considering the embedding and clustering problems with respect to social properties, GEMSEC extracts high-quality clusters competitive with or superior to other community detection algorithms. In experiments, the method is found to be computationally efficient and robust to the choice of hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of infectious diseases spread via direct person-to-person transmission (such as influenza, smallpox, HIV/AIDS, etc.) depends on the underlying host contact network. Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics. These results have implications for the design of control strategies.},

Previous methods on graph representation learning mainly focus on static graphs, however, many real-world graphs are dynamic and evolve over time. In this paper, we present Dynamic Self-Attention Network (DySAT), a novel neural architecture that operates on dynamic graphs and learns node representations that capture both structural properties and temporal evolutionary patterns. Specifically, DySAT computes node representations by jointly employing self-attention layers along two dimensions: structural neighborhood and temporal dynamics. We conduct link prediction experiments on two classes of graphs: communication networks and bipartite rating networks. Our experimental results show that DySAT has a significant performance gain over several different state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines.},

Such as, how large scale and centralized these criminal communities are currently? While these types of analysis have been completed in the past, we wanted to explore how to construct a large scale social graph from a smaller set of leaked data that included only the criminal's email addresses. We begin our analysis by constructing a 43 thousand node social graph from one thousand publicly leaked criminals' email addresses. This is done by locating Facebook profiles that are linked to these same email addresses and scraping the public social graph from these profiles. We then perform a large scale analysis of this social graph to identify profiles of high rank criminals, criminal organizations and large scale communities of criminals. Finally, we perform a manual analysis of these profiles that results in the identification of many criminally focused public groups on Facebook. This analysis demonstrates the amount of information that can be gathered by using limited data leaks.},

  abstract = {Social systems are in a constant state of flux, with dynamics spanning from minute-by-minute changes to patterns present on the timescale of years. Accurate models of social dynamics are important for understanding the spreading of influence or diseases, formation of friendships, and the productivity of teams. Although there has been much progress on understanding complex networks over the past decade, little is known about the regularities governing the microdynamics of social networks. Here, we explore the dynamic social network of a densely-connected population of {$\sim$}1,000 individuals and their interactions in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured via Bluetooth, as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media contacts, geolocation, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow us to observe social groups directly, rendering community detection unnecessary. Starting from 5-min time slices, we uncover dynamic social structures expressed on multiple timescales. On the hourly timescale, we find that gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a stable core of individuals. Each core represents a social context. Cores exhibit a pattern of recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with varying degrees of regularity. Taken together, these findings provide a powerful simplification of the social network, where cores represent fundamental structures expressed with strong temporal and spatial regularity. Using this framework, we explore the complex interplay between social and geospatial behavior, documenting how the formation of cores is preceded by coordination behavior in the communication networks and demonstrating that social behavior can be predicted with high precision.},

Applications on massive dynamic networks require more efficient solutions and lead to incremental community detection, which revises the community assignments of new or changed vertices during network updates. In this paper, we propose to use machine learning classifiers to predict the vertices that need to be inspected for community assignment revision. This learning-based targeted revision (LBTR) approach aims to improve community detection efficiency by filtering out the unchanged vertices from unnecessary processing. In this paper, we design features that can be used for efficient target classification and analyze the time complexity of our framework. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, which show our LBTR approach significantly reduces the computational time while keeping a high community detection quality. Furthermore, as compared with the benchmarks, we find our approach's performance is stable on both growing networks and networks with vertex/edge removals. Experiments suggest that one should increase the target classification precision while keeping recall at a reasonable level when implementing our proposed approach. The study provides a unique perspective in incremental community detection.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new community detection algorithm, called Attractor, which automatically spots communities in a network by examining the changes of "distances" among nodes (i.e. distance dynamics). The fundamental idea is to envision the target network as an adaptive dynamical system, where each node interacts with its neighbors. The interaction will change the distances among nodes, while the distances will affect the interactions. Such interplay eventually leads to a steady distribution of distances, where the nodes sharing the same community move together and the nodes in different communities keep far away from each other. Building upon the distance dynamics, Attractor has several remarkable advantages: (a) It provides an intuitive way to analyze the community structure of a network, and more importantly, faithfully captures the natural communities (with high quality). (b) Attractor allows detecting communities on large-scale networks due to its low time complexity (O(|E|)). (c) Attractor is capable of discovering communities of arbitrary size, and thus small-size communities or anomalies, usually existing in real-world networks, can be well pinpointed. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm allows the effective and efficient community detection and has good performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The main category, i.e., deep neural networks, is further divided into convolutional networks, graph attention networks, generative adversarial networks and autoencoders. The survey also summarizes the popular benchmark data sets, model evaluation metrics, and open-source implementations to address experimentation settings. We then discuss the practical applications of community detection in various domains and point to implementation scenarios.

We classify the methods into the objective function they optimize. Each objective function class is classified into clustering categories. Each category is further classified into clustering methods. Methods are further classified into sub-methods and so on. Thus, the lowest subclass in a hierarchy is a fine-grained and specific method. For each method, we survey the different techniques in literature employed by the method. We empirically and experimentally compare and rank the different methods that fall under each clustering category. We also empirically and experimentally compare and rank the different categories that optimize a same objective function.

Specifically, the system focuses on: 1) Extracting researcher profiles automatically from the Web; 2) Integrating the publication data into the network from existing digital libraries; 3) Modeling the entire academic network; and 4) Providing search services for the academic network. So far, 448,470 researcher profiles have been extracted using a unified tagging approach. We integrate publications from online Web databases and propose a probabilistic framework to deal with the name ambiguity problem. Furthermore, we propose a unified modeling approach to simultaneously model topical aspects of papers, authors, and publication venues. Search services such as expertise search and people association search have been provided based on the modeling results. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main features of the system. We also present the empirical evaluation of the proposed methods.},

Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the ``LINE,'' which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine.

  abstract = {Online social networks have become extremely popular; numerous sites allow users to interact and share content using social links. Users of these networks often establish hundreds to even thousands of social links with other users. Recently, researchers have suggested examining the activity network - a network that is based on the actual interaction between users, rather than mere friendship - to distinguish between strong and weak links. While initial studies have led to insights on how an activity network is structurally different from the social network itself, a natural and important aspect of the activity network has been disregarded: the fact that over time social links can grow stronger or weaker. In this paper, we study the evolution of activity between users in the Facebook social network to capture this notion. We find that links in the activity network tend to come and go rapidly over time, and the strength of ties exhibits a general decreasing trend of activity as the social network link ages. For example, only 30\% of Facebook user pairs interact consistently from one month to the next. Interestingly, we also find that even though the links of the activity network change rapidly over time, many graph-theoretic properties of the activity network remain unchanged.},

With these interests, in the paper we firstly display some basic but dynamic features of social networks. Then on its basis, we propose a novel core-based algorithm of tracking community evolution, CommTracker, which depends on core nodes to establish the evolving relationships among communities at different snapshots. With the algorithm, we discover two unique phenomena in social networks and further propose two representative coefficients: GROWTH and METABOLISM by which we are also able to distinguish social networks from nonsocial ones from the dynamic aspect.

Then a novel similarity is proposed by combing structural perturbation and topological features. Finally, we present an evolutionary clustering algorithm to detect dynamic communities under the temporal smoothness framework. Experimental results on both artificial and real dynamic networks demonstrate that the proposed similarity is promising in dynamic community detection since it improves the clustering accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, indicating the superiority of the presented similarity measure.},

The evolutionary clustering framework provides a temporal smoothness constraint for simultaneously maximizing the clustering quality at the current time step and minimizing the clustering deviation between two successive time steps. Based on this framework, some existing methods, such as the evolutionary spectral clustering and evolutionary nonnegative matrix factorization, aim to look for the low-dimensional representation by mapping reconstruction. However, such reconstruction does not address the nonlinear characteristics of networks. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm (sE-Autoencoder) to overcome the effects of nonlinear property on the low-dimensional representation. Our proposed method extends the typical nonlinear reconstruction model to the dynamic network by constructing a temporal matrix. More specifically, the potential community characteristics and the previous clustering, as the prior information, are incorporated into the loss function as a regularization term. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and superior to other methods for dynamic community detection.},

However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.},

In this paper, we analyse Dutch public sentiment on governmental COVID-19 measures from text data collected across three online media sources (Twitter, Reddit and Nu.nl) from February to September 2020. We apply sentiment analysis methods to analyse polarity over time, as well as to identify stance towards two specific pandemic policies regarding social distancing and wearing face masks.

One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods.},

While there are many algorithms that perform community detection, the more accurate and statistically robust algorithms tend to be slow and hard to parallelize. One way to speed up such algorithms is through data reduction. However, this approach has not been thoroughly studied, and the quality of results obtained with this approach varies with the graph it is applied to. In this manuscript, we present an approach based on topology-guided sampling for accelerating stochastic block partitioning - a community detection algorithm that works well on graphs with complex and heterogeneous community structure. We also introduce a degree-based thresholding scheme that improves the efficacy of our approach at the expense of speedup. Finally, we perform a series of experiments on synthetically generated graphs to determine how various graph parameters affect the quality of results and speedup obtained with our approach, and we validate our approach on real-world data. Our results show that our approach can lead to a speedup of up to 15X over stochastic block partitioning without sampling while maintaining result quality and can even lead to improvements of over 150\% in result quality in terms of F1 score on certain kinds of graphs.},

Meanwhile, data objects with mixed numeric and categorical attributes are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, topological methods are usually applied to point cloud data, and to the best of our knowledge there is no available framework for the classification of mixed data using topological methods. In this paper, we propose a novel topological machine learning method for mixed data classification. In the proposed method, we use theory from topological data analysis such as persistent homology, persistence diagrams and Wasserstein distance to study mixed data. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments on a real-world heart disease dataset. Experimental results show that our topological method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in the prediction of heart disease.},

The individual tends to get in touch with the closest friends. By that a direction from one node to its closest nodes can be obtained, and the formed directed network could easily find out the communities. It is different from the traditional community detection policies, which only consider the global topological structure of the social network. Accord to the theory above, we designed the RWS (Random Walk Sampling) method to detect the overlapping communities, utilizing the random walk method to find the closest friends for each node. As the topological structure changing, the proposed ARWS (Adaptive Random Walk Sampling) could make the impacted nodes find out the new closest friends and the changed communities adaptively. The ARWS only update the impacted nodes and communities as the dynamic events occurring, while the traditional dynamic community detection methods need to break up and restructure the communities after the topology changing, because the tradition methods are based on the global topological structure. Therefore, the ARWS has a lower cost than the traditional methods. Furthermore, the ARWS focus on the individual, fitting to the decentralized computing framework, such as distributed computation and cloud computing. That is the trend of the artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Detecting and tracking communities in dynamic social networks has been a grand multidisciplinary challenge. There are two key steps in tracking the community evolution of dynamic social networks, including dynamic community detection and evolutionary events identification. For dynamic community detection, incremental clustering has been used as one of the most efficient methods; however, incrementally detecting network communities may result in partition errors such that continuous error accumulation will cause a discrepancy between the computed community structure and the underlying ground-truth. For evolutionary events identification, core-node-based methods have been widely employed; however, they do not distinguish between the heterogeneous contributions of core nodes to different evolutionary events, thereby resulting in a reduced accuracy of evolutionary event identification. This paper introduces a novel two-stage method that circumvents both of these problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose an error accumulation sensitive (EAS) incremental community detection method for dynamic social networks. In our novel EAS method, rather than updating the community structure partially, a dynamic network snapshot is totally re-partitioned once the error accumulation degree of incremental clustering exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Secondly, to identify different critical evolution events, we introduce a superspreaders and superblockers (SAS) based community evolution tracking method for dynamic social networks which utilizes the properties of superspreader and superblocker nodes, the two types of core nodes related to spreading outbreaks in social networks. Experiments conducted on artificial and real-world social networks demonstrate that our proposed method can both efficiently detect dynamic network communities and accurately identify all critical evolutionary events, outperforming a total of eight competing methods. Our two-stage EAS-SAS approach could thus represent a potential method of choice for many real-world applications to community discovery and community evolution tracking in dynamic social networks.},

  abstract = {One of the main organizing principles in real-world networks is that of network communities, where sets of nodes organize into densely linked clusters. Communities in networks often overlap as nodes can belong to multiple communities at once. Identifying such overlapping communities is crucial for the understanding the structure as well as the function of real-world networks. Even though community structure in networks has been widely studied in the past, practically all research makes an implicit assumption that overlaps between communities are less densely connected than the non-overlapping parts themselves. Here we validate this assumption on 6 large scale social, collaboration and information networks where nodes explicitly state their community memberships. By examining such ground-truth communities we find that the community overlaps are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that community overlaps are more sparsely connected than the communities themselves. Practically all existing community detection methods fail to detect communities with dense overlaps. We propose Community-Affiliation Graph Model, a model-based community detection method that builds on bipartite node-community affiliation networks. Our method successfully captures overlapping, non-overlapping as well as hierarchically nested communities, and identifies relevant communities more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods in networks ranging from biological to social and information networks.},

Identifying communities in networks has proven to be a challenging task mainly due to a plethora of definitions of a community, intractability of algorithms, issues with evaluation and the lack of a reliable gold-standard ground-truth. We study a set of 230 large social, collaboration and information networks where nodes explicitly define group memberships. We use these groups to define the notion of ground-truth communities. We then propose a methodology which allows us to compare and quantitatively evaluate different definitions of network communities on a large scale. We choose 13 commonly used definitions of network communities and examine their quality, sensitivity and robustness. We show that the 13 definitions naturally group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions, Conductance and Triad-participation-ratio, consistently give the best performance in identifying ground-truth communities.},

Recent literature on this topic has reached a consensus that node contents and link structures should be integrated for reliable graph clustering, especially in an unsupervised setting. However, existing methods based on shallow models often suffer from content noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose to utilize deep embedding for graph clustering, motivated by the well-recognized power of neural networks in learning intrinsic content representations. Upon that, we capture the dynamic nature of networks through the principle of influence propagation and calculate the dynamic network embedding. Network clusters are then detected based on the stable state of such an embedding. Unlike most existing embedding methods that are task-agnostic, we simultaneously solve for the underlying node representations and the optimal clustering assignments in an end-to-end manner. To provide more insight, we theoretically analyze our interpretation of network clusters and find its underlying connections with two widely applied approaches for network modeling. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets including both social networks and citation networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art.},

Since there has already been a broad body of HNE algorithms, as the first contribution of this work, we provide a generic paradigm for the systematic categorization and analysis over the merits of various existing HNE algorithms.

As the second contribution, we create four benchmark datasets with various properties regarding scale, structure, attribute/label availability, and etc. from different sources, towards handy and fair evaluations of HNE algorithms.

  abstract = {Community structure is ubiquitous in real-world complex networks. The task of community detection over these networks is of paramount importance in a variety of applications. Recently, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely adopted for community detection due to its great interpretability and its natural fitness for capturing the community membership of nodes. However, the existing NMF-based community detection approaches are shallow methods. They learn the community assignment by mapping the original network to the community membership space directly. Considering the complicated and diversified topology structures of real-world networks, it is highly possible that the mapping between the original network and the community membership space contains rather complex hierarchical information, which cannot be interpreted by classic shallow NMF-based approaches. Inspired by the unique feature representation learning capability of deep autoencoder, we propose a novel model, named Deep Autoencoder-like NMF (DANMF), for community detection. Similar to deep autoencoder, DANMF consists of an encoder component and a decoder component. This architecture empowers DANMF to learn the hierarchical mappings between the original network and the final community assignment with implicit low-to-high level hidden attributes of the original network learnt in the intermediate layers. Thus, DANMF should be better suited to the community detection task. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DANMF can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art NMF-based community detection approaches.},

However, making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains an unsolved challenge. Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm, which combines efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to generate embeddings using a trained model. Overall, we can train on and embed graphs that are four orders of magnitude larger than typical GCN implementations. We show how GCN embeddings can be used to make high-quality recommendations in various settings at Pinterest, which has a massive underlying graph with 3 billion nodes representing pins and boards, and 17 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user studies, as well as A/B tests, our approach generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable deep learning based systems. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures.},

Evolutionary clustering is often utilized for the goal and has achieved some success, however, still has some major drawbacks: (1) The absence of error correction may lead to the result-drifting problem and the error accumulation problem; (2) The NP-hardness of modularity based community detection makes it low efficiency to get an exact solution. In this paper, an efficient and effective multi-objective method, namely DYN-MODPSO, is proposed, and where the traditional evolutionary clustering framework and the particle swarm algorithm are modified and enhanced, respectively. The main contributions include that: (1) A novel strategy, namely the recent future reference, is devised for the initial clustering result correction to make the dynamic community detection more effective; (2) The traditional particle swarm algorithm is improved and integrated with the evolutionary clustering framework by profitably exploiting the proposed strategy; (3) The de-redundant random walk based population initialization is proposed to diversify the individuals in a quality-guaranteed way. Furthermore, the multi-individual crossover operator and the improved interference operator are carefully designed to keep the solution from local optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on the real and the synthetic dynamic networks manifest that the proposed DYN-MODPSO outperforms the competitors in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

Community detection is the task of discovering dense groups of vertices in a graph. Its one specific form is seed set expansion, which finds the best local community for a given set of seed vertices. Greedy, agglomerative algorithms, which are commonly used in seed set expansion, have been previously designed only for a static, unchanging graph. However, in many applications, new data are constantly produced, and vertices and edges are inserted and removed from a graph. We present an algorithm for dynamic seed set expansion, which maintains a local community over time by incrementally updating as the underlying graph changes. We show that our dynamic algorithm outputs high-quality communities that are similar to those found when using a standard static algorithm. It works well both when beginning with an already existing graph and in the fully streaming case when starting with no data. The dynamic approach is also faster than re-computation when low latency updates are needed.},

BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior.},

In real world, networks, like social network and biological networks, are dynamic and evolving over time. However, almost all the existing network embedding methods focus on static networks while ignore network dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning approach, DynamicTriad, to preserve both structural information and evolution patterns of a given network. The general idea of our approach is to impose triad, which is a group of three vertices and is one of the basic units of networks. In particular, we model how a closed triad, which consists of three vertices connected with each other, develops from an open triad that has two of three vertices not connected with each other. This triadic closure process is a fundamental mechanism in the formation and evolution of networks, thereby makes our model being able to capture the network dynamics and to learn representation vectors for each vertex at different time steps. Experimental results on three real-world networks demonstrate that,  compared with several state-of-the-art techniques, DynamicTriad achieves substantial gains in several application scenarios. For example, our approach can effectively be applied and help to identify telephone frauds in a mobile network, and to predict whether a user will repay her loans or not in a loan network.},
