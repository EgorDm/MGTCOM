# Research questions

* ~ RQ1. Does consideration of temporal evolution of meta topology-based and content-based features lead to higher consistency and quality communities within dynamic community detection?
* WIP RQ2. Does a density based representation for communities the more general representation of temporal communities than the current state of the art (leading nodes or membership assignment)? 
* WIP RQ3. What deep representation learning architecture works best for twitter dynamic social network?



* Improve exisiting methods by
  * Incoporating metapath info
  * Metapath can replace topic modelling
  * RQ:
    * Is approach better than graph based
    * Is the representation more generalizable
