# Introduction and Backgrounds

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a huge part of the Network Science field and is concerned with the process of investigating social structures that occur in real-world using Network and Graph Theory. These social structures usually include social media networks, economic transaction networks, knowledge networks and disease transmission networks.
One main issue to address while studying this type of real-world events lies in identification of meaningful substructures hidden within the overall complex system. The SNA is therefore applied to extract patterns from the data usually in form of information flow, identification of high throughput nodes and paths, and discovery of communities and clusters. In this thesis we are going to focus on the problem of community discovery.

This thesis proposal is structured as follows: in this sections we are going to introduce basic concepts and challenges of Dynamic Community Detection. In +@research-questions we will describe the problem we are trying to solve as well as formulate the research questions. In +@literature-review a brief literature survey is conducted on identifying current state of the art and approaches to Community Detections. In +@approach we will elaborate on our methodology for solving the posed problem and answering the research questions. Finally, in +@planning the concrete planning for the research project is laid out.

## Community Detection

Problem of partitioning a complex network into *communities* which represent groups of individuals with high interaction density while individuals from different communities have comparatively low interaction density is known as Community Discovery (CD). CD is a task of fundamental importance within CD as it discloses deeper properties of networks. It provides insight into networksâ€™ internal structure and its organizational principles.

Many useful applications of CD have been studied by researchers including identification of criminal groups [@sarvariConstructingAnalyzingCriminal2014], social bot detection [@karatasReviewSocialBot2017], targeted marketing [@mosadeghUsingSocialNetwork2011], and public health / disease control [@salatheDynamicsControlDiseases2010].

With the explosion of human- and machine-generated data, often collected by social platforms, more datasets are emerging having rich temporal information that can be studied. CD operates only on static networks. Meaning that their temporal dimension is often omitted, which often does not yield a good representation of the real-world where networks constantly evolve. Such networks are often referred to as dynamic networks as their components such as nodes and edges may appear and fade from existence. Accordingly community detection on such dynamic networks is called Dynamic Community Detection (DCD).

DCD algorithms, by incorporating additional temporal data are often able to both outperform their counterpart CD algorithms @faniUserCommunityDetection2020, as well as providing additional information about communities for analysis [@pallaQuantifyingSocialGroup2007]. This additional information comes in form of community events such as (birth, growth, split, merging, and death) or in form of ability to track membership of certain individuals over time.

## Challenges in Community Detection

DCD is seen as the hardest problem within Social Network Analysis. Reason for this is mainly because DCD, unlike CD, also involves tracking the found communities over time. This tracking relies on consistency of the detected communities as usually slight changes to the network may cause a different community membership assignment.

Additionally, increasing richness of the data is not only limited to temporal data. The real-world data often connects entities of different modalities together. This multi-modality occurs through the fact that the entities and relations themselves may be of different kinds (meta topology-based features). For example users, topics and user-produced documents in a social network, or vehicles and landmarks in a traffic network. Another example of multi-modality in networks comes in form of node and relation features (content-based features). These features may come in form of structured (numerical, categorical or vector data) or unstructured data such as images and text. It is of high importance to explore this multi-modal data as it may not always be possible to explain the formation of communities using network structural information alone.

As noted earlier, meta topological features may be used to differentiate between different kind of nodes or edges to encode additional information. TODO: talk about appearance and disappearance of nodes, asymmetric edges, etc

Finally, a more common issue is that there is no common definition for a community structure. Within networks it is usually described in terms of membership assignment, while in more content-based settings communities are described in terms of distributions over topics which usually represent interest areas. The first definition only accounts for disjoint communities, while second is too vague as there may also be overlapping and hierarchical communities.

* In contrast to k-means clustering tasks, the amount of communities is unknown
