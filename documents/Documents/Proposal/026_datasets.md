## Datasets

% * Curate the popular dataset used in literature
% * Start by discussing Synthetic Datasets
%   * Their properties and assumptions they are based on
% * Then we discuss Real World Datasets
%   * Describe properties

In this section, we curate popular datasets used in literature for CD and DCD tasks. First, we discuss methods for generating synthetic datasets containing ground-truth communities. We conclude this section with an overview of real-world dynamic networks.



### Synthetic Datasets

Synthetic Datasets are datasets generated by specific models on manually designed rules. These datasets are generated with communities in mind and therefore most of the time contain ground-truth communities which can be used for the evaluation of CD algorithms. In this section, we describe a selection of popular synthetic data set generation techniques.



% * Generated by specific models on manually designed rules 
% * @lancichinettiBenchmarkGraphsTesting2008 (LFR)
%   * Most common benchmark
%     * Accounts for heterogenity of degree and community size
%     * simulates the degree of nodes in a real-world network and the scale-free nature of the network
%     * Modularity based
%     * Static communities
%   * Each node is given degree from power of law distribution
%   * Each node shares as fraction $\mu$ of links with its community
%   * Sizes of communities are taken from power of law distribution
%   * Rewirings are applied to keep degrees the same and distribution between in and out links
% * @lancichinettiBenchmarksTestingCommunity2009
%   * Extension for overlapping communities

The most common benchmark dataset is was introduced in @lancichinettiBenchmarkGraphsTesting2008. Their method for generating the network generates communities and their nodes with size and degree drawn from a power-law distribution. After that node edge rewiring is applied that enforces mixture parameter $\mu$ which determines the ratio of in- to between-community connections. In follow-up [@lancichinettiBenchmarksTestingCommunity2009] the authors extend their method to work for overlapping communities.



% @greeneTrackingEvolutionCommunities2010
% 
% * Generation is based on @lancichinettiBenchmarkGraphsTesting2008
% * Extend to generate graph snapshots
% * Changes are controlled by injecting user-specified community events

In @greeneTrackingEvolutionCommunities2010 the authors modify the @lancichinettiBenchmarkGraphsTesting2008 method to generate dynamic community networks. They do this by defining a set of community events that can be used as seeds for the temporal evolution of the network. The subsequent snapshots of the graph are defined by this set of events.



% @granellBenchmarkModelAssess2015
% 
% * Propose a model for generating simple dynamic networks
% * based on stochastic block models
% * Time evolution consists of periodic oscillation of the systems structure between configurations 
% * Method: 
%   * Graph is divided in subgraph communities
%   * Their interconnecitons have a probabiliy
%   * Their intra-connecitons have probabilitily
%   * Edges are drawn from binom distribution
%   * Implements growing and shrinking, merge and split actions by modifying these probabilities for ceratian subsets

@granellBenchmarkModelAssess2015 propose a model for generating simple dynamic networks based on stochastic block models (SBM). The time evolution consists of periodic oscillation of the system's structure between configurations. Once the initial network is created, it is divided into subgraphs each having certain inter-and intra- connectivity probability. The edges between the timestamps are drawn from binomial distributions which themselves are modified by stochastic community-based events such as shrinking, growing, merging, and splitting.



% @ghalebiDynamicNetworkModel2019
% 
% * Develeop a generative dynamic network model from partial observations (diffusion data)
% * Assuming each nodes belongs to a cluster where a model is created modelling the ingoing and outgoing edges
% * Model can be used to determine model parameters from real world datasets and generate similar ones

@ghalebiDynamicNetworkModel2019 similarly proposes an SBM model-based approach to generate dynamic community networks. Additionally, they propose a methodology to learn model parameters from existing real-world networks.



### Real World Datasets

% * Can be categorized into
%   * Citation/Co-authorship Networks
%   * Social Networks
%   * Biological
%   * Webpage
%   * Purchasing/co-purchasing
% * We describe their scale in terms of Node and Edge count
%   * Most of the datasets have meta topological information in terms of Node types
%   * As edge types are not common we ignore this data 
%   * Additionally we list the amount of available attributes

Real-world network datasets are often categorized based on the source they model such as social networks, biological networks, and webpage networks. In +@tbl:realworlddatasets we present an overview of the most commonly used datasets in the literature. For each of the datasets, we describe their scale in terms of their node and edge counts. Additionally, we specify the presence of meta-topological information in form of node types, whether the network is dynamic, whether it includes content-based (unstructured/textual) information, and the availability of node features.
