\begin{abstract}
Recent developments in big data and graph representation learning have
allowed researchers to make breakthroughs in social network analysis and
the identification of communities. While opening a lot of research
opportunities, such approaches are highly limited to snapshots of
rapidly evolving social networks. This, in fact, is a great
simplification of the real-world situation which is always evolving and
expanding by the user and/or machine interactions.\\
\strut \\
Relying on novel research of dynamic graph representation learning, the
goal of my thesis project is to build a framework for community
detection and representation in evolving heterogeneous networks. To
verify the merit of the proposed framework, it will be evaluated against
baselines on static heterogeneous graphs, and analyzed against gathered
twitter dataset on covid measures.

\section{Introduction and
Backgrounds}\label{introduction-and-backgrounds}}

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a huge part of the Network Science
field and is concerned with the process of investigating social
structures that occur in the real-world using Network and Graph Theory.
These social structures usually include social media networks, economic
transaction networks, knowledge networks, and disease transmission
networks.

One main issue to address while studying this type of real-world events
lies in the identification of meaningful substructures hidden within the
overall complex system. The SNA is therefore applied to extract patterns
from the data usually in form of information flow, identification of
high throughput nodes and paths, and discovery of communities and
clusters. In this thesis, we are going to focus on the problem of
community discovery.

This thesis proposal is structured as follows: in this section, we are
going to introduce basic concepts and challenges of Dynamic Community
Detection. In \cref{literature-review} a brief literature survey is
conducted on identifying the current state of the art and approaches to
Dynamic Community Detection. In \cref{research-questions} we will
describe the problem we are trying to solve as well as formulate the
research questions. In \cref{approach} we will elaborate on our proposed
methodology for solving the posed problem and answering the research
questions. Finally, in \cref{planning} the concrete planning for the
research project is laid out.

\hypertarget{community-detection}{%
\subsection{Community Detection}\label{community-detection}}

The problem of partitioning a complex network into \emph{communities}
which represent groups of individuals with high interaction density,
while individuals from different communities have comparatively low
interaction density is known as Community Discovery (CD). CD is a task
of fundamental importance within SNA as it discloses deeper properties
of networks. It provides insight into networks' internal structure and
its organizational principles.

Many useful applications of CD have been studied by researchers
including identification of criminal groups
\citep{sarvariConstructingAnalyzingCriminal2014}, social bot detection
\citep{karatasReviewSocialBot2017}, targeted marketing
\citep{mosadeghUsingSocialNetwork2011}, and public health/disease
control \citep{salatheDynamicsControlDiseases2010}.

With the explosion of human- and machine-generated data, often collected
by social platforms, more datasets are emerging having rich temporal
information that can be studied. CD operates only on static networks.
Meaning that their temporal dimension is often omitted, which often does
not yield a good representation of the real world, where networks
constantly evolve. Such networks are often referred to as dynamic
networks as their components such as nodes and edges may appear and fade
from existence. Accordingly community detection on such dynamic networks
is called Dynamic Community Detection (DCD).

DCD algorithms incorporate additional temporal data are often able to
both outperform their counterpart CD algorithms
\citep{granellBenchmarkModelAssess2015, liuCommunityDetectionMultiPartite2016, faniUserCommunityDetection2020, rossettiANGELEfficientEffective2020},
as well as provide additional information about communities for analysis
\citep{pallaQuantifyingSocialGroup2007}. This additional information
comes in form of community events such as (birth, growth, split,
merging, and death) or in form of the ability to track the membership of
certain individuals over time.

\hypertarget{challenges-in-community-detection}{%
\subsection{Challenges in Community
Detection}\label{challenges-in-community-detection}}

DCD is seen as the hardest problem within Social Network Analysis. The
reason for this is mainly because DCD, unlike CD, also involves tracking
the found communities over time. This tracking relies on the consistency
of the detected communities, as usually slight changes to the network
may cause a different community membership assignment. Not properly
accounting for this uncertainty may cause community and result drift
\citep{dakicheTrackingCommunityEvolution2019}.

Additionally, the increasing richness of the data is not only limited to
temporal data. The real-world data often connects entities of different
modalities. This multi-modality occurs through the fact that the
entities and relations themselves may be of different types (meta
topology-based features). For example users, topics, and documents in a
social network (or vehicles and landmarks in a traffic network). More
complex networks may include asymmetric relationships, and temporal
networks may include appearing, disappearing, or streaming edges/nodes.

Another example of multi-modality in networks comes in form of node and
relation features (content-based features). These features may come in
form of structured (numerical, categorical, or vector data) or
unstructured data such as images and text. It is of high importance to
explore this multi-modal data as it may not always be possible to
explain the formation of communities using network structural
information alone.

Finally, a more systematic issue is that there is no common definition
for a community structure. Within networks, it is usually described in
terms of membership assignment, while in more content-based settings
communities are described in terms of modeled topics (that usually
represent interest areas) or distributions over latent similarity space.
Both definitions have their shortcomings as they often fail to account
for more complex community structures (such as overlapping and
hierarchical communities) and non-linearity of structures often found in
the real world.

Task of community detection is often compared to clustering and graph
clustering, which not always may be a fair comparison as a main focus
point in many CD algorithms is the fact that the amount of communities
is unknown a priori. Communities are not are never planted in the real
world and the algorithms should detect them in an unsupervised manner.

\hypertarget{literature-review}{%
\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}}

The problem of dynamic community detection was noticed quite early on
within the SNA community and a considerable amount of research has been
made in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the network. While
the said research was mostly focused on the discovery of communities
using topologically-based features and node connectivity, the covered
methods did research the limitations and challenges posed by a temporal
context.

In recent years, significant developments have been made in the space of
deep learning. Mainly in the development of new deep learning methods
capable of learning graph-structured data
\citep{bronsteinGeometricDeepLearning2017, hamiltonRepresentationLearningGraphs2018, kipfSemiSupervisedClassificationGraph2017}
which is fundamental for SNA. Because of this, various problems within
the field have been revisited, including community detection problems.
The approaches have been expanded by incorporation of more complex
features, solving the problems concerning multi-modality, and
introduction of unsupervised learning.

Despite this resurgence, the DCD problem has received little attention.
Though a few efforts have been made to incorporate the deep learning
methods by introducing content-based similarity dynamic, the definition
of unified constraints for end-to-end learning, and usage of graph
representation-based CD algorithms within a temporal context, the
current state of the art leaves a lot to be desired.

We structure the literature as follows: first, we describe the various
interpretations of the Community Structure in
\cref{community-structures}. Next, we explore various approaches and
techniques related to Graph Representation Learning in
\cref{graph-representation-learning}. Then, we provide an overview of
the current state-of-the-art approaches for Community Detection and
Dynamic Community Detection tasks in \cref{link-based-approaches} and
+\citet{repesentation-based-approaches}. Finally, we discuss the ways to
evaluate the said algorithms in \cref{evaluation} and the datasets
available in \cref{datasets}.

\hypertarget{community-structures}{%
\subsection{Community Structures}\label{community-structures}}

\hypertarget{communities}{%
\subsubsection{Communities}\label{communities}}

Communities in real-world networks can be of different kinds: disjoint
(think of students belonging to different educational institutions),
overlapping (person having membership in different social groups) and
hierarchical (components of a car). One of the main reasons behind the
complexity of CD is the unclear definition what a community actually is.

The \emph{link-based} (referred to as classic) community detection
methods intuitively describe communities as groups of nodes within a
graph, such that the intra-group connections are denser than the
intergroup ones. This definition is primarily based on the
\emph{homophily} principle, which refers to the assumption that similar
individuals are those that are densely connected together. Therefore,
these kind of methods look for sub-graph structures such as cliques and
components that identify connectedness within the graph structure to
represent the communities.

Unfortunately, in most cases link-based methods fall short to identity
communities of similar individuals. This is mainly due to two facts: (i)
many similar individuals in a social network are not explicitly
connected together, (ii) an explicit connection does not necessarily
indicate similarity, but may explained by sociological processes such as
conformity, friendship or kinship
\citep{diehlRelationshipIdentificationSocial2007, faniUserCommunityDetection2020}.

A more general definition is introduced in
\citep{cosciaClassificationCommunityDiscovery2011} to create an
underlying concept generalizing all variants found in the literature. In
link-based methods, a direct connection is considered as a particular
and very important kind of action, while newer methods also consider
content or interest overlap.

\protect\hypertarget{thm:id}{}{Community}

\begin{quote}
A community in a complex network is a set of entities that share some
closely correlated sets of actions with the other entities of the
community.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{dynamic-communities}{%
\subsubsection{Dynamic Communities}\label{dynamic-communities}}

Similarly to how communities can be found in static networks, dynamic
communities extends this definition by utilizing the temporal dimension
to define its life cycle/evolution over a dynamic network. A dynamic
community is defined as a collection of communities and set of
transformations on thesis communities over time.

This persistence across time of communities subjected to progressive
changes is an important problem to tackle. Since as noted by
\citep{rossettiCommunityDiscoveryDynamic2018} it can be compared to the
famous ``the ship of Theseus'' paradox. Because (verbatim),
\emph{deciding if an element composed of several entities at a given
instant is the same or not as another one composed of some---or even
none---of such entities at a later point in time is necessarily
arbitrary and cannot be answered unambiguously}.

Most of the works agree on two atomic transformations on the
communities, including node/edge appearance and vanishing. While some
such as
\citep[\citet{cazabetUsingDynamicCommunity2012}]{pallaQuantifyingSocialGroup2007, asurEventbasedFrameworkCharacterizing2009}
define a more extensive set of transformations (also referred to as
events) which may be more interesting for analytical purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Birth, when a new community emerges at a given time.~
\item
  Death, when a community disappears. All nodes belonging to this
  community lose their membership.
\item
  Growth, when a community acquires some new members (nodes).
\item
  Contraction, when a community loses some of its members.
\item
  Merging, when several communities merge to form a new community.
\item
  Splitting, when a community is divided into several new ones.
\item
  Resurgence, when a community disappears for a period and reappears.
\end{itemize}

These events / transformations are often not explicitly used during the
definition and/or representation of dynamic communities. Nevertheless,
most of the methods covered discussed in the following sections do
defined a way in their algorithm to extract such event from the
resulting data.

Finally, is important to note that dynamic networks can differ in
representation. They can be represented as either a time-series of
static networks (also referred to as snapshots), or as a real time
stream of edges (referred to as temporal networks). Though, it should be
noted that within the context of dynamic community detection they can be
seen as equivalent as the conversion between the two representations can
be done in a lossless way.

\hypertarget{graph-representation-learning}{%
\subsection{Graph Representation
Learning}\label{graph-representation-learning}}

Representation-based approach stems from the field of computation
linguistics which relies heavily on the notion of \emph{distributional
semantics} which states that words that occur in similar contexts are
semantically similar. Therefore the word representations are learned as
dense low dimensional representation vectors (embeddings) of a word in a
latent similarity space by predicting words based on their context or
vice versa
\citep{mikolovEfficientEstimationWord2013, penningtonGloveGlobalVectors2014}.
Using the learned representations similarity, clustering and other
analytical metrics can be computed.

Success of these representation learning approaches has spread much
farther than just linguistics and can be applied to graph representation
learning. Methods such as deepwalk
\citep{perozziDeepWalkOnlineLearning2014}, LINE
\citep{tangLINELargescaleInformation2015} and node2vec
\citep{groverNode2vecScalableFeature2016} use random walks to sample the
neighborhood/context in a graph (analogous to sentences in linguistic
methods) and output vector representations (embeddings) that maximize
the likelihood of preserving topological structure of nodes within the
graph.

Whereas previously the structural information features of graph entities
had to be hand engineered, these new approaches are data driven, save a
lot of time labeling the data, and yield superior feature /
representation vectors. The methods can be trained to optimize for
\emph{homophily} on label prediction or in an unsupervised manner on
link prediction tasks.

Newer approaches introduce possibility for fusion of different data
types. GraphSAGE \citep{hamiltonInductiveRepresentationLearning2018} and
Author2Vec \citep{wuAuthor2VecFrameworkGenerating2020} introduce
methodology to use node and edge features during representation learning
process. Other approaches explore ways to leverage heterogeneous
information present within the network by using \emph{metapath} based
random walks (path defined by a series of node/link types)
\citep{dongMetapath2vecScalableRepresentation2017} or by representing
and learning relations as translations within the embedding space
\citep{bordesTranslatingEmbeddingsModeling2013}. In
\citet{nguyenContinuousTimeDynamicNetwork2018} the authors introduce a
way to encode temporal information by adding chronological order
constraints to various random walk algorithms. Other relevant
advancements within the field include Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
\citep{kipfSemiSupervisedClassificationGraph2017a} and (Variational)
Graph Auto-Encoders (GAE) \citep{kipfVariationalGraphAutoEncoders2016}
which present more effective ways to summarize and represent larger
topological neighborhoods or whole networks.

\hypertarget{evaluation}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}}

As described in the previous sections, the definition for both community
and dynamic community may be quite ambiguous. In this section we will
cover how detection and tracking results can be evaluated in a lesser
ambiguous setting to compare various approaches. To disambiguate the
process a little, during evaluation, the resemblance/detection and
matching/tracking tasks are evaluated separately.

\hypertarget{annotated}{%
\subsubsection{Annotated}\label{annotated}}

Evaluation of detected (dynamic) communities becomes much easier when
the \emph{ground truth communities} are provided. The evaluation is then
done by comparing the difference between the produced communities and
the effective ones. To perform this comparison, information theory based
metric Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is used which converts
community sets to bit-strings and quantifies the ``amount of
information'' can be obtained about one community by observing the other
\citep{lancichinettiDetectingOverlappingHierarchical2009}.

A possible drawback of this measure is that its complexity is quadratic
in terms of identified communities. In
\citep{rossettiNovelApproachEvaluate2016} alternative measure (NF1) with
linear complexity is introduced which similarly to F1 score uses the
trade-off between precision and recall (of the average of harmonic
means) of the matched communities. In the follow-up work
\citep{rossettiANGELEfficientEffective2020} the authors describe a way
to apply this measure within the context of DCD by calculating this
score for all the snapshots and aggregating the results into one single
measure.

In real-world there are usually no ground truth communities. Therefore
this approach is usually applied on synthetic datasets where the
communities and their dynamicity is sampled from a distribution.
Alternative approach some papers take is by defining ground truth
communities using the metadata and node attributes present within the
datasets. Some datasets may include annotated communities, but this is
not common within DCD datasets.

\hypertarget{metric-based}{%
\subsubsection{Metric based}\label{metric-based}}

Evaluation of detected (dynamic) communities becomes much easier when
the \emph{ground truth communities} are provided. The evaluation is then
done by comparing the difference between the produced communities and
the effective ones. To perform this comparison, information theory based
metric Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is used which converts
community sets to bit-strings and quantifies the ``amount of

\citep{lancichinettiDetectingOverlappingHierarchical2009}.

communities using the metadata and node attributes present within the
datasets. Some datasets may include annotated communities, but this is
not common within DCD datasets.

\hypertarget{task-specific}{%
\subsubsection{Task specific}\label{task-specific}}

In \citep{peelGroundTruthMetadata2017} the authors criticize these
evaluation approaches by proving that they introduce severe theoretical
and practical problems. For one, they prove the no free lunch theorem
for CD, ie. they prove that algorithmic biases that improve performance
on one class of networks must reduce performance on others. Therefore,
there can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community
detection tasks, as quality of communities may differ by the optimized
metrics. Additionally, they demonstrate that when a CD algorithm fails,
the poor performance is indistinguishable from any of the three
alternative possibilities: (i) the metadata is irrelevant to the network
structure, (ii) the metadata and communities capture different aspects
of network structure, (iii) the network itself lacks structure.
Therefore, which community is optimal should depend on it's subsequent
use cases and not a single measure.
