# Research Questions

% The main goal of my thesis: to build a framework for community detection and representation in dynamic heterogeneous networks.
% 
% * This in order to analyse the communities within the set of datasets provided by Prof. Wang (todo cite work)
%   * Datasets are Dynamic, Heterogenous, Include content-based data
%   * Combination poses a problem
% * To the best of my knowledge: there are currently no algorithms that can do this
% * Direct comparison is therefore impossible
% * To validate merit and performance of the model we split task into research questions
%   * Does addition of meta-topological and/or content-based information improve quality of detected communities?
%   * Does usage of sparse graph representation learning techniques improve scale of community detection beyond current state of the art?
%   * Does usage of representation based approaches provide more temporally smooth communities?
%   * Does making temporal features implicit in node embeddings provide better quality communities as opposed to making them explicit?
% * In the
