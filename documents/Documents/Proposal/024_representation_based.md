## Representation-based Approaches

% * Work similarly as link-based methods
%   * Based on the idea of homophily (connected nodes are similar)
% * Instead of directly modelling based on connection
%   * They learn an intermediate representation
%   * Benefits is that it solves non-linearity problem real-world networks have
%   * Representations are more robust against noise
% * The representations are beneficial because
%   * They can encode auxiliary objectives
%   * Multi-modal features such as content
%   * Network (meta) structure and Temporal dimension
%   * Are naturally easy to compute similarity on

The main difference between Representation-based approaches and link-based approaches is the fact that they usually don't directly model the network based on connections. Instead they learn an intermediate representation of the graph or its components to which CD detection can be applied to. While also relying on the idea of *homophily*, most of methods define additional objectives to improve community quality.

The main reasoning for this is the fact that real-world networks are non-linear, meaning that there may  be no connections when then make sense and vice versa. By using deep neural networks to learn these embeddings one can address such non-linearity as they are in general very robust against noise. Other notable benefits to using representation-based approaches include the fact that they compress the data efficiently as real-world networks are very sparse. They can also represent multi-modal features, network (meta) structure and temporal dimension by defining them all in a compatible similarity space or learning mappings to this space. Finally, representations are naturally easy to compute similarity on.

In this section we describe representation based approaches by first covering a number of works on CD and how their approaches can be characterized. Afterwards we cover a number of papers that extend these ideas to the DCD problem.



### Community Detection

#### Affiliation Graph Networks

% @yangCommunityAffiliationGraphModel2012
% 
% AGM: Affiliation Graph Model: a generative model $B(V, C, M, \{p_c\})$ for graphs
% 
% * $V$ vertices, $C$ communities, $M$ community memberships,
% * ${p_c}$ model parameters (probability matrix) representing connection probabilities
% * Can model variety of community structures: (all have distinct characteristics in M)
%   * Non-overlapping, Overlapping and hierarchical
% * Usage: Generative Model: (generating edges)
%   * generates links for each pair of nodes in community $A$ with probability $p_a$ 
%   * The more communities they have in common, means higher probability for a connection
%   * If no overlap, then $P(u, v) = \epsilon$
% * Usage: Discriminative Model: Given a graph, find a model $F$ that may have generated it
%   * Assume a model was generated by AGM
%   * Parameters $M$, number of communities $C$, $p_c$
%   * Graph Fitting: using max likelihood estimation
%     * Given a model, it can be compared to data using log likelihood
%     * AGM is relaxed to have edge strength
%     * Using the relaxed model memberships now have strengths $F_uC$
%     * Probability of two nodes connecting is defined in terms of them connecting through a community
%     * Gradient descent is used to find the optimal parameters



#### Graph Augmentation

% * @kangCommunityReinforcementEffective2021
%   * Present a **Community Reinforcement** approach
%     * Is CD algorithm agnostic
%       * Shown in experiments - therefore the graph itself benefits
%     * Reinforces the Graph by
%       * Creating inter-community edges
%       * Deleting intra-community edges
%       * Determines the appropriate amount of reinforcement a graph needs
%     * Which helps the dense inter-community and sparse intra-community property of the graph
%       * Can effectively turn difficult-to-detect community situation into that of easy-to-detect communities
%     * Challenges:
%       * Needs to be unsupervised (doesn't need community annotations to work)
%       * Appropriate amount of reinforcement needs to be determined (otherwise noise is introduced)
%       * Needs to be fast, checking every possible edge is infeasible
%     * Methodology:
%       * Edge Addition / Deletion
%         * Based on node similarity of connected pairs
%           * Similar nodes are likely to be in a community (intra edges)
%           * Dissimilar ones are less likely to be in a community (inter edges)
%         * Employ graph embedding to generate topological embeddings
%           * Adamic/Adar (local link-based)
%           * SimRank (gloabl link-based)
%           * Node2vec graph embedding based
%         * Predict similarities and bucket them
%           * Use similarity buckets to select intra and inter edges - and to tune the model
%           * Buckets are selected on how well they predict current edges
%       * Detect the right amount of addition
%         * Use a gradual reinforcement strategy by generating a series of graphs (adding top x inter and removing intra edges)
%         * Pick the best graph using a scoring function (modularity)
%         * Simply run CD over the graph and see
%       * Reducing comutational overhead
%         * Using a greedy similarity computation
%         * Prefer nodes which are likely to be in same community of inter similarity detection
%     * Tests results on:
%       * Synthetic Graphs: LFR
%       * Real world graphs: Cora, Siteseer, DBLP, Email



% * @huangInformationFusionOriented2022
%   * Their own made dataset (rumor detection): [GitHub - MingqingHuang-SHU/HRTCD: Information Fusion Oriented Heterogeneous Social Network for Friend Recommendation via Community Detection](https://github.com/MingqingHuang-SHU/HRTCD)
%   * Recommendation of friends based on per user detected communities
%   * Communities are detected on per user contructed subnetworks.
%   * Approach supports multiple communities per user, but is not one of global community detection



% * @luberCommunityDetectionHashtagGraphsSemiSupervised2021
%   * Not really focused on community detection
%   * More focused on enhancing topic modelling using community detection
%   * Communities are from Hashtag graphs which help encode structural / content-based information of the tweets in context of other tweets



#### Multi-objective optimization

%   * Evaluate embeddings by genre prediction / recommendation



% * @jiaCommunityGANCommunityDetection2019
%   * Has some info in related work to extend on graph representation learning
%   * Solves issue of detecting overlapping communities:
%     * K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model cant do that
%   * Proposes CommunityGAN:
%     * Solves graph representation learning and community detection jointly
%     * Embeddings indicate the membership strength of vertices to communities
%     * Make use of Affiliation Graph Model AGM for community (detection) assignment
%     * Uses GAN structure to:
%       * Generate most likely vertext subset s to compose a specified kind of motif
%         * "Graph AGM" motif generation model
%       * Discriminate whether vertex subset s is a real motif or not
%       * Motif = in this case is an n-clique
%     * Study motif distribution among ground truth communities to analyse how they impact quality of detected communities
%   * Methodology:
%     * Define a method to efficiently random walk such cliques / motifs
%     * Generator tries to learn p_{true}(m|v_c) as preference distribution of motifs containing v_c vs all the motifs
%       * To be able to generate most likely motifs (vertex subsets) similar to real motifs covering v_c
%     * Discriminator tries to learn probability of a vertex subset being a real motif
%       * Tries to discriminate between ground truth motifs and not
%     * AGM:
%       * Can define a measure to check whether two nodes are affiliated through a specific (or any) community
%       * Usually applied for edge generation
%       * In this case, extended to motif generation (edge is a 2-clique)
%         * The affiliation is defined now in form of a motif in community
%     * Amount of communities are chosen by hyperparameter tuning



% * @yangGraphClusteringDynamic2017
%   * Goal: unsupervised clustering on networks with contents
%     * Propose a way to utilize deep embedding for graph clustering
%   * Simultaneously solve node representation problem and find optimal clustering in a e2e manner
%     * Jointly learns embeddings X and soft clustering q_i \in Q
%     * \sum_k q_{ik}: probablility of node v_i belonging to kth cluster
%     * K is known a-priori
%   * Employ Deep Denoise Autoencoder (DAE) - good for features with high-dimensional sparse noisy inputs
%   * Use stable influence propagation technique (for computing embeddings)
%     * Use a transition matrix for a single step embedding propagation
%     * Because:
%       * Random walk requires more tuning
%       * Their transition matrix is very similar to a spectral method (symmetric Laplacian matrix)
%       * Influence propagation is like kipf and welling - doenst require matrix decomposition
%     * Embedding loss: \mathcal{J}*{1}=\sum*{i=1}^{n} l\left(\mathrm{a}*{i}, \tilde{\mathrm{a}}*{i}\right)
%   * Introduce GRACE cluster module:
%     * Computes soft clustering Q from: q_{i k}=\frac{\left(1+\left\|\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{u}_{k}\right\|^{2}\right)^{-1}}{\sum_{j}\left(1+\left\|\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{u}_{j}\right\|^{2}\right)^{-1}}
%     * Learn clustering results by learning distribuition P where p_{i k}=\frac{q_{i k}^{2} / f_{k}}{\sum_{j} q_{i j}^{2} / f_{j}}
%       * and f_{k}=\sum_{i} q_{i k} total number of nodes softly assigned to kth cluster
%     * Clustering Loss: \mathcal{J}_{2}=K L(\mathcal{P} \| Q)=\sum_{i} \sum_{k} p_{i k} \log \frac{p_{i k}}{q_{i k}}
%     * Training is done in alternating steps:
%       * Macrostep: Compute: P and fix it
%       * S Microsteps: Update node embeddings S and cluster centers U
%         * Tries to make Q catch up with P



### Dynamic Community Detection

% * @faniUserCommunityDetection2020
%   * Propose a new method of identifying user communities through multimodal feature learning:
%     * learn user embeddings based on their **temporal content similarity**
%       * Base on topics of interest
%       * Users are considered like-minded if they are interested in similar topics at similar times
%       * Learn embeddings using a context modelling approach
%     * learn user embeddings based on their **social network connections**
%       * Use GNN which works as a skip-gram like approach by generating context using random walks
%     * **interpolate** temporal content-based embeddings and social link-based embeddings
%   * Then they use these multimodal embeddings to detect dynamic communities\
%     * Communities are detected on a modified graph
%       * Weights are set given embedding similarity
%       * Communities are detected using louvain methods
%     * Then test their approach on specific tasks such as
%     * News recommendation
%     * User for content prediction
%   * Note: **This approach detects static communities**
%     * But the communities implicitly take time into account



% * @wangVehicleTrajectoryClustering2020
%   * Transform task of trajectory clustering into one of Dynamic Community Detection
%     * discretion the trajectories by recording entity their current neigbors at each time interval
%     * Edge streaming network is created
%   * Use representation learning to learn node their embeddings
%     * Use dyn walks to perform random walks in time dimenstion
%     * Use negative sampling to avoid the softmax cost
%   * Then use K-means to find the communities
%     * Try K-means, K-medioids and GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models)
%     * Initalize the centers at the previous timestamp centers
%   * Use quality measures to establish quality of results



#### Multi-objective optimization

% * @wangEvolutionaryAutoencoderDynamic2020
%   * Approach is similar to to @maCommunityawareDynamicNetwork2020
%   * Defines a unified objective where
%     * community characteristics
%     * previous clustering
%     * are incorporated as a regularization term
%   * **They argue that real world networks are non-linear** in nature and **classical approaches can not capture this**
%     * Autoencoders can though
%   * Methodology:
%     * Construct a similarity matrix using Dice Coefficient (handles varying degrees well)
%     * Apply stacked (deep) autoencoders to learn the low-dimensional representation
%     * Characterizes tradeoff between two costs:
%       * Snapshot cost (SC):
%         * Reconstruction loss
%         * Node embedding similarity (homophiliy) between connected nodes
%         * Node embedding similarity (homophiliy) between nodes in same community
%       * Temporal cost (TC)
%         * Temporal smoothness of node embeddings
%     * Adopt K-means to discover community structures



% * @maCommunityawareDynamicNetwork2020 (use as baseline?)
%   * Define communities in terms of large and small scale communities
%   * They propose a method for dynamic *community aware* network representation learning
%     * By creating a unified objective optimizing stability of communities, temporal stability and structure representation
%     * Uses both first-order as well as second order proximity for node representation learning
%   * They define community representations as average of their members
%     * Adopt a stacked autoencoder to learn low-dimensional (generic) representations of nodes
%   * They define loss in terms of:
%     * Reconstruction Error: How well the graph can be reconstructed from the representation
%     * Local structure preservation: Preservation of homophiliy - connected nodes are similar
%     * Community evolution preservation: Preservation of smoothness of communities in time at multiple granularity levels
%   * The communities are initialized using classical methods:
%     * First large communities are detected using Genlouvin (fast and doesnt require priors)
%     * Then small scale communities are detected using k-means by defining a max community size w
%       * Which provides more fine tuned communities
%   * Using the initial embeddings the temporal embeddings are optimized
%     * Done by optimizing all at once - therefore maintaining the stability
%     * And use of the mentioned combined objective
%   * Though they present / evaluate their algorithm in terms of Dynamic Representation Algorithms
%     * Therefore the actual quality of communities remains to be known
