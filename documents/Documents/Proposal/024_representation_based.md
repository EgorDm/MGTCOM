## Representation-based Approaches

% * Work similarly as link-based methods
%   * Based on the idea of homophily (connected nodes are similar)
% * Instead of directly modelling based on connection
%   * They learn an intermediate representation
%   * Benefits is that it solves non-linearity problem real-world networks have
%   * Representations are more robust against noise
% * The representations are beneficial because
%   * They can encode auxiliary objectives
%   * Multi-modal features such as content
%   * Network (meta) structure and Temporal dimension
%   * Are naturally easy to compute similarity on

The main difference between Representation-based approaches and link-based approaches is the fact that they usually don't directly model the network based on connections. Instead they learn an intermediate representation of the graph or its components to which CD detection can be applied to. While also relying on the idea of *homophily*, most of methods define additional objectives to improve community quality.

The main reasoning for this is the fact that real-world networks are non-linear, meaning that there may  be no connections when then make sense and vice versa. By using deep neural networks to learn these embeddings one can address such non-linearity as they are in general very robust against noise. Other notable benefits to using representation-based approaches include the fact that they compress the data efficiently as real-world networks are very sparse. They can also represent multi-modal features, network (meta) structure and temporal dimension by defining them all in a compatible similarity space or learning mappings to this space. Finally, representations are naturally easy to compute similarity on.

In this section we describe representation based approaches by first covering a number of works on CD and how their approaches can be characterized. Afterwards we cover a number of papers that extend these ideas to the DCD problem.



### Community Detection

% TODO: Not sure what to put here yet.



#### Affiliation Graph Models

% @yangCommunityAffiliationGraphModel2012
% 
% AGM: Affiliation Graph Model: a generative model $B(V, C, M, \{p_c\})$ for graphs
% 
% * $V$ vertices, $C$ communities, $M$ community memberships,
% * ${p_c}$ model parameters (probability $p_c$ per community $c$ indicating a connection strength.)
% * Can model variety of community structures: (all have distinct characteristics in M)
%   * Non-overlapping, Overlapping and hierarchical (TODO: add figure?)
% * Usage: Generative Model: (generating edges)
%   * generates links for each pair of nodes in community $A$ with probability $p_a$ 
%   * The more communities they have in common, means higher probability for a connection
%   * If no overlap, then $P(u, v) = \epsilon$
% * Usage: Discriminative Model: Given a graph, find a model $F$ that may have generated it
%   * Assume a model was generated by AGM
%   * Parameters $M$, number of communities $C$, $p_c$
%   * Graph Fitting: using max likelihood estimation
%     * Given a model, it can be compared to data using log likelihood
%     * AGM is relaxed to have edge strength
%     * Using the relaxed model memberships now have strengths $F_uC$
%     * Probability of two nodes connecting is defined in terms of them connecting through a community
%     * Gradient descent is used to find the optimal parameters

While arguably not being representational by itself, Affiliation Graph Network (AGM) model introduced in @yangCommunityAffiliationGraphModel2012 is very influential within deep learning / representation learning CD field.

The AGM models a network as a bipartite graph with communities as first class citizens and is represented by the following equation $B(V, C, M, \{p_c\})$, where $V$ represents nodes, $C$ set of communities, $M$ node-community memberships and $\{p_c\}$ model parameters (a single probability $p_c$ per community). It can model non-overlapping, overlapping and hierarchical communities by defining rules on membership sets in $M$. AGM can used in both generative and discriminative settings.

The generative scenario goes as follows: Given an AGM $F$ generate links between each pair of nodes exceeding a baseline probability $p$. The can be done by considering that according to AGM, each pair of nodes in community $A$ is connected with a probability $p_A$. Therefore, the probability of two nodes having a connection is proportional to the amount of communities they share (which is defined in the model).

The discriminative scenario is defined as: Given a graph $G$ and , find a model $F$ that may have generated it. By assuming that the graph was generated using an AGM, the parameters $M$, number of communities $|C|$ and $\{p_c\}$ have to be found. Process for finding such a model to the graph usually max likelihood fitting. AGM is relaxed to have membership strengths $F_{uC}$, which helps to define probability of nodes $u$ and $v$ connecting through community $C$ ($P_{C}(u, v)$), and in terms of that by themselves $P(u, v)$. Using this a probability $P(G|F)$ can be constructed quantifying how well the model fits the data. Finally, gradient ascent can be applied optimizing the model parameters.



#### Graph Augmentation

% Class of methods for Community Detection: Graph Augmentation
% 
% * These type of method use representation learning techniques to 
%   * Enhance the graph (augmentation) by adding valuable edges
%   * Remove noise by adding missing connections or removing noisy ones
% * TODO: non-linearity, sparsity of real-world graphs

The first class of methods we consider are Graph Augmentation methods. These methods use representation based learning techniques to to enhance the graph by adding valuable edges or reduce the noise by removing noisy connections. This is usually by training a model on a link-prediction task. A notable benefit of this approach is that other well known CD methods can be used on the enhanced graph afterwards.



% @kangCommunityReinforcementEffective2021
% 
% * Present a **Community Reinforcement** approach
% * Is CD algorithm agnostic
%   * Shown in experiments - therefore the graph itself benefits
% * Reinforces the Graph by
%   * Creating inter-community edges
%   * Deleting intra-community edges
%   * Determines the appropriate amount of reinforcement a graph needs
% * Which helps the dense inter-community and sparse intra-community property of the graph
%   * Can effectively turn difficult-to-detect community situation into that of easy-to-detect communities
% * Challenges:
%   * Needs to be unsupervised (doesn't need community annotations to work)
%   * Appropriate amount of reinforcement needs to be determined (otherwise noise is introduced)
%   * Needs to be fast, checking every possible edge is infeasible
% * Methodology:
%   * Edge Addition / Deletion
%     * Based on node similarity of connected pairs
%       * Similar nodes are likely to be in a community (intra edges)
%       * Dissimilar ones are less likely to be in a community (inter edges)
%     * Employ graph embedding to generate topological embeddings
%       * Adamic/Adar (local link-based)
%       * SimRank (gloabl link-based)
%       * Node2vec graph embedding based
%     * Predict similarities and bucket them
%       * Use similarity buckets to select intra and inter edges - and to tune the model
%       * Buckets are selected on how well they predict current edges
%   * Detect the right amount of addition
%     * Use a gradual reinforcement strategy by generating a series of graphs (adding top x inter and removing intra edges)
%     * Pick the best graph using a scoring function (modularity)
%     * Simply run CD over the graph and see
%   * Reducing computational overhead
%     * Using a greedy similarity computation
%     * Prefer nodes which are likely to be in same community of inter similarity detection

@kangCommunityReinforcementEffective2021 present a CD algorithm agnostic pre-processing method for strengthening community structure of a graph by adding non-existing predicted intra-community edges and deleting existing predicted inter-community edges. Their strategy is to learn topological embedding using a graph representation learning algorithm (node2vec) based on existing link prediction task. The similarity is computed between different node pairs and put into buckets. Then with assumption of *homophily* the buckets with higher value can be considered holding intra-community while buckets with lower inter-community connections. Right buckets are picked from both extremes to create or delete edges. Preemptive CD is done to greedily guide pair-wise similarity computation and avoid a high complexity.

#### Multi-objective optimization

% * @wangEvolutionaryAutoencoderDynamic2020
%   * Approach is similar to to @maCommunityawareDynamicNetwork2020
%   * Defines a unified objective where
%     * community characteristics
%     * previous clustering
%     * are incorporated as a regularization term
%   * **They argue that real world networks are non-linear** in nature and **classical approaches can not capture this**
%     * Autoencoders can though
%   * Methodology:
%     * Construct a similarity matrix using Dice Coefficient (handles varying degrees well)
%     * Apply stacked (deep) autoencoders to learn the low-dimensional representation
%     * Characterizes tradeoff between two costs:
%       * Snapshot cost (SC):
%         * Reconstruction loss
%         * Node embedding similarity (homophiliy) between connected nodes
%         * Node embedding similarity (homophiliy) between nodes in same community
%       * Temporal cost (TC)
%         * Temporal smoothness of node embeddings
%     * Adopt K-means to discover community structures



% * @maCommunityawareDynamicNetwork2020 (use as baseline?)
%   * Define communities in terms of large and small scale communities
%   * They propose a method for dynamic *community aware* network representation learning
%     * By creating a unified objective optimizing stability of communities, temporal stability and structure representation
%     * Uses both first-order as well as second order proximity for node representation learning
%   * They define community representations as average of their members
%     * Adopt a stacked autoencoder to learn low-dimensional (generic) representations of nodes
%   * They define loss in terms of:
%     * Reconstruction Error: How well the graph can be reconstructed from the representation
%     * Local structure preservation: Preservation of homophiliy - connected nodes are similar
%     * Community evolution preservation: Preservation of smoothness of communities in time at multiple granularity levels
%   * The communities are initialized using classical methods:
%     * First large communities are detected using Genlouvin (fast and doesnt require priors)
%     * Then small scale communities are detected using k-means by defining a max community size w
%       * Which provides more fine tuned communities
%   * Using the initial embeddings the temporal embeddings are optimized
%     * Done by optimizing all at once - therefore maintaining the stability
%     * And use of the mentioned combined objective
%   * Though they present / evaluate their algorithm in terms of Dynamic Representation Algorithms
%     * Therefore the actual quality of communities remains to be known
