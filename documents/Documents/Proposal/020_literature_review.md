# Literature Review

The problem of dynamic community detection was noticed quite early on in within the SNA community and a considerable amount of research have been made in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the network. While the said research was mostly focused on discovery of communities using topologically-based features and node connectivity, the covered methods did research the limitations and challenges posed by a temporal context.

In the recent years, significant developments have been made in the space of deep learning. Mainly in the development of new deep learning methods capable of learning graph-structured data [@bronsteinGeometricDeepLearning2017; @hamiltonRepresentationLearningGraphs2018; @kipfSemiSupervisedClassificationGraph2017] which is fundamental for SNA. Various of problems within the field have been revisited, including the community detection problems. The approaches have been expanded by incorporation of more complex features, solving the problems concerning multi-modality and introduction of unsupervised learning.

Despite this resurgence, the DCD problem has received little attention. Though a few efforts have been made to incorporate the deep learning methods by introducing content-based similarity dynamic and usage of graph representation based CD algorithms within a temporal context, the current state of the art leaves a lot to be desired.



% We structure this literature review as follows: first we describe the various interpretations of the community structure @community-structures, explore the current datasets and evaluation methods used for benchmarking of the current DCD methods @evaluation-methods. Then, we dive in the current state of the art works on DCD by discussing both “classic” methods and novel deep learning based methods +@datasets. Finally, we discuss the current advances within the graph representation learning [] and community detection [] approaches.
