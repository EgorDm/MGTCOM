# Planning

% * Split planning (20 weeks) into sprints (2 weeks)
% * Deadline: June 13th 2022

In this section, the approximate planning for my thesis is discussed. The research phase of the thesis is broken down into two week blocks. Below a timeline of these sprints can be found along with goals expected to achieve by the end of the block. The final deadline for the thesis is June 13th 2022.



## Timeline

### January 24 - 2 weeks

% * Implement the baselines
% * Set up experimentation setup and benchmarks

Preparing the datasets, and setting up benchmarks for the baseline methods. Implementation of baseline if implementation is not publicly available.  

### February 5 - 2 weeks

% * Finishing up benchmark implementation
% * Conducting evaluation of existing baselines on the set RQ benchmarks

Finishing up the benchmark implementation. Conducting the evaluation and collection of the results on the baselines for the RQ's.

### February 19 - 2 weeks

% * Setting up graph sampling pipeline a dataset
% * Experimentation with representation based approaches (performance comparison)

Setting up graph sampling pipeline and experimentation with various representation based approaches. Collecting performance results for ablation tests.

### March 3 - 2 weeks

% * Experimenting and implementing incorporation of community based objectives into the framework
% * Conducting experiments for answering RQ3

Experimenting and implementing incorporation of community-based objectives into the framework. Conducting experiments with temporal modelling for RQ @thm:rq3.

### March 19 - 2 weeks

% * Finishing up Experimenting and implementing incorporation of community based objectives
% * Experimenting with community extraction and sub sampling

Finishing up experimenting and implementing incorporation of community-based objectives into the framework. Experimenting with community extraction and sub-sampling.

### April 2 - 2 weeks

% * Evalutation and tuning of the algorithm parameters for RQ1, and RQ2

Evaluation and tuning of the algorithm parameters to collect results for RQ @thm:rq1 and @thm:rq4

### April 10 - 2 weeks

% * Evaluation and optimization of the algorithm for scalability,
% * Testing of the algorithm against RQ3

Evaluation and optimization of the algorithm for scalability. Collecting data for RQ @thm:rq2.
