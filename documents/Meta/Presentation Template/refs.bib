  abstract = {Graph embedding methods represent nodes in a continuous vector space, preserving information from the graph (e.g. by sampling random walks). There are many hyper-parameters to these methods (such as random walk length) which have to be manually tuned for every graph. In this paper, we replace random walk hyper-parameters with trainable parameters that we automatically learn via backpropagation. In particular, we learn a novel attention model on the power series of the transition matrix, which guides the random walk to optimize an upstream objective. Unlike previous approaches to attention models, the method that we propose utilizes attention parameters exclusively on the data (e.g. on the random walk), and not used by the model for inference. We experiment on link prediction tasks, as we aim to produce embeddings that best-preserve the graph structure, generalizing to unseen information. We improve state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of real world datasets including social, collaboration, and biological networks. Adding attention to random walks can reduce the error by 20\% to 45\% on datasets we attempted. Further, our learned attention parameters are different for every graph, and our automatically-found values agree with the optimal choice of hyper-parameter if we manually tune existing methods.},

  abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only `traditional ' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

There have been many studies in the literature targeted at studying and mining these graphs. However, almost all of them have studied these graphs from a static point of view. The study of the evolution of these graphs over time can provide tremendous insight on the behavior of entities, communities and the flow of information among them. In this work, we present an event-based characterization of critical behavioral patterns for temporally varying interaction graphs. We use nonoverlapping snapshots of interaction graphs and develop a framework for capturing and identifying interesting events from them. We use these events to characterize complex behavioral patterns of individuals and communities over time. We show how semantic information can be incorporated to reason about community-behavior events. We also demonstrate the application of behavioral patterns for the purposes of modeling evolution, link prediction and influence maximization. Finally, we present a diffusion model for evolving networks, based on our framework.},

  abstract = {Many complex systems composed of interacting objects like social networks or the web can be modeled as graphs. They can usually be divided in dense sub-graphs with few links between them, called communities and detecting this un-derlying community structure may have a major impact in the understanding of these systems. We focus here on evolving graphs, for which the usual approach is to represent the state of the system at different time steps and to compute communities independently on the graph obtained at each time step.  We propose in this paper to use a different framework: instead of detecting communities on each time step, we detect a unique decomposition in communities that is relevant for (almost) every time step during a given period called the time window. We propose a definition of this new decomposition and two algorithms to detect it quickly. We validate both the approach and the algorithms on three evolving networks of different kinds showing that the quality loss at each time step is very low despite the constraint of maximization on several time steps. Since the time window length is a crucial parameter of our technique, we also propose an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to build automatically a hierarchical time segmentation into time windows. This clustering relies on a new similarity measure based on community structure. We show that it is very efficient in detecting meaningful windows.},

  abstract = {Multilayer networks allow one to represent diverse and coupled connectivity patterns --- e.g., time-dependence, multiple subsystems, or both --- that arise in many applications and which are difficult or awkward to incorporate into standard network representations. In the study of multilayer networks, it is important to investigate mesoscale (i.e., intermediate-scale) structures, such as dense sets of nodes known as communities, to discover network features that are not apparent at the microscale or the macroscale. The ill-defined nature of mesoscale structure and its ubiquity in empirical networks make it crucial to develop generative models that can produce the features that one encounters in empirical networks. Key purposes of such generative models include generating synthetic networks with empirical properties of interest, benchmarking mesoscale-detection methods and algorithms, and inferring structure in empirical multilayer networks. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the construction of generative models for mesoscale structures in multilayer networks. Our framework provides a standardized set of generative models, together with an associated set of principles from which they are derived, for studies of mesoscale structures in multilayer networks. It unifies and generalizes many existing models for mesoscale structures in fully-ordered (e.g., temporal) and unordered (e.g., multiplex) multilayer networks. One can also use it to construct generative models for mesoscale structures in partially-ordered multilayer networks (e.g., networks that are both temporal and multiplex). Our framework has the ability to produce many features of empirical multilayer networks, and it explicitly incorporates a user-specified dependency structure between layers.},

In many applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks, on the scale of billions), and are natural targets for machine learning techniques. In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and manifolds. The purpose of this paper is to overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications, and future research directions in this nascent field.},

We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a framework on multiple real-world datasets, and show that it improves graph visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.},

We first create an evolving network of terms, which is an abstraction of the complete network, and then run a dynamic community detection algorithm on this evolving network. In order to be able to detect not only short, bursting events, but also more persistent topics, we test our solution on a social network for which we have information about all published contents for a period of more than 2~years: the Japanese network Nico Nico Douga. After presenting our solution in detail, we present the results on this dataset, notably a statistical analysis of communities' sizes and durations, examples of detected communities, and a typology of the different kinds of trends detected.

In this work, we argue that, instead of developing separate approaches for detecting overlapping communities, a promising alternative is to infer the overlapping communities from multiple disjoint community structures. We propose an ensemble-based approach, called EnCoD, that leverages the solutions produced by various disjoint community detection algorithms to discover the overlapping community structure. Specifically, EnCoD~generates a feature vector for each vertex from the results of the base algorithms and learns which features lead to detect densely connected overlapping regions in an unsupervised way. It keeps on iterating until the likelihood of each vertex belonging to its own community maximizes. Experiments on both synthetic and several real-world networks (with known ground-truth community structures) reveal that EnCoD~significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art overlapping community detection algorithms Finally, we show that EnCoD~is generic enough to be applied to networks where the vertices are associated with explicit semantic features. To the best of our knowledge, EnCoD~is the second ensemble-based overlapping community detection approach after MEDOC Chakraborty (2016).},

  abstract = {The discovery of evolving communities in dynamic networks is an important research topic that poses challenging tasks. Evolutionary clustering is a recent framework for clustering dynamic networks that introduces the concept of temporal smoothness inside the community structure detection method. Evolutionary-based clustering approaches try to maximize cluster accuracy with respect to incoming data of the current time step, and minimize clustering drift from one time step to the successive one. In order to optimize both these two competing objectives, an input parameter that controls the preference degree of a user towards either the snapshot quality or the temporal quality is needed. In this paper the detection of communities with temporal smoothness is formulated as a multiobjective problem and a method based on genetic algorithms is proposed. The main advantage of the algorithm is that it automatically provides a solution representing the best trade-off between the accuracy of the clustering obtained, and the deviation from one time step to the successive.

In this setting (which is a special case of several existing models), we are able to derive the detectability threshold exactly, as a function of the rate of change and the strength of the communities. Below this threshold, we claim that no algorithm can identify the communities better than chance. We then give two algorithms that are optimal in the sense that they succeed all the way down to this limit. The first uses belief propagation (BP), which gives asymptotically optimal accuracy, and the second is a fast spectral clustering algorithm, based on linearizing the BP equations. We verify our analytic and algorithmic results via numerical simulation, and close with a brief discussion of extensions and open questions.},

  abstract = {Detecting the time evolution of the community structure of networks is crucial to identify major changes in the internal organization of many complex systems, which may undergo important endogenous or exogenous events. This analysis can be done in two ways: considering each snapshot as an independent community detection problem or taking into account the whole evolution of the network. In the first case, one can apply static methods on the temporal snapshots, which correspond to configurations of the system in short time windows, and match afterwards the communities across layers. Alternatively, one can develop dedicated dynamic procedures, so that multiple snapshots are simultaneously taken into account while detecting communities, which allows us to keep memory of the flow. To check how well a method of any kind could capture the evolution of communities, suitable benchmarks are needed. Here we propose a model for generating simple dynamic benchmark graphs, based on stochastic block models. In them, the time evolution consists of a periodic oscillation of the system's structure between configurations with built-in community structure. We also propose the extension of quality comparison indices to the dynamic scenario.},

Here we describe a model for tracking the progress of communities over time in a dynamic network, where each community is characterised by a series of significant evolutionary events. This model is used to motivate a community-matching strategy for efficiently identifying and tracking dynamic communities. Evaluations on synthetic graphs containing embedded events demonstrate that this strategy can successfully track communities over time in volatile networks. In addition, we describe experiments exploring the dynamic communities detected in a real mobile operator network containing millions of users.},

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

Among state-of-the-art methods, incremental algorithms based on modularity have been used widely, for the fully utilization of both current and historical information. Unfortunately, they are difficult to uncover small community due to problem called ``resolution limit'' and also sensitive to the sequence of network increments' arrival. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic community detection algorithm based on distance dynamics, which detects community in near-linear time. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods by replacing modularity with local interaction model. In a sense, it is assumed that increments can be treated as disturbance of network. It can be limited to a certain ``local area'' by disturbing factor. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has achieved well balance between efficiency and effectiveness both in synthetic and real world networks.},

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

With the recent development of deep learning, graph representation learning techniques are also utilized for community detection. However, the communities can only be inferred by applying clustering algorithms based on learned vertex embeddings. These general cluster algorithms like K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model cannot output much overlapped communities, which have been proved to be very common in many real-world networks. In this paper, we propose CommunityGAN, a novel community detection framework that jointly solves overlapping community detection and graph representation learning. First, unlike the embedding of conventional graph representation learning algorithms where the vector entry values have no specific meanings, the embedding of CommunityGAN indicates the membership strength of vertices to communities. Second, a specifically designed Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) is adopted to optimize such embedding. Through the minimax competition between the motif-level generator and discriminator, both of them can alternatively and iteratively boost their performance and finally output a better community structure. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate that CommunityGAN achieves substantial community detection performance gains over the state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we present a novel preprocessing method for strengthening the community structure of a given graph by adding non-existent predicted intra-community edges and deleting existing predicted inter-community edges for more accurate community detection. Our preprocessing method does not require any extra information for community reinforcement nor any changes of existing algorithms for community detection. To realize our method, we propose the following three strategies: (1) predicting intra-community and inter-community edges, (2) determining the amount of edges to be added/deleted, and (3) reducing the amount of computations in predicting the type of edges. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments with various existing community detection algorithms on 11 synthetic and 6 real-world graphs. The results demonstrate that (1) our method significantly improves the accuracy up to 91\%, regardless of community detection algorithms and graphs and (2) it outperforms two state-of-the-art edge weighting-based preprocessing methods in improving the accuracy up to 105\%.},

Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e. the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a new class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this new benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization and Potts model clustering. The results show that the new benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.},

This is a challenging problem since this type of sensor data is very noisy, often incomplete with many missing values, and easily perturbed by motion and nearby obstacles, especially in very dynamic indoor environments. The key idea of our approach is to transform the original noisy sensor data into specific feature vectors by a series of statistical methods designed to overcome the challenges in the data. These features vectors, reflecting the interaction between people, are then clustered to reveal communities without the need to rely on localization information or pre-defined interaction models and parameters. Our data-driven approach provides robust community detection that is not sensitive to noise and missing signals, and automatically captures the dynamic interaction between people.

The aim of IM is to select a set of k users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that DISCO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. Besides, we also show that the learning model exhibits good generality.},

In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer based large-scale spectral clustering method to strike a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness. In the proposed method, a divide-and-conquer based landmark selection algorithm and a novel approximate similarity matrix approach are designed to construct a sparse similarity matrix within low computational complexities. Then clustering results can be computed quickly through a bipartite graph partition process. The proposed method achieves the lower computational complexity than most existing large-scale spectral clustering. Experimental results on ten large-scale datasets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Most existing works on this problem are based on a very strict assumption that the seed node only belongs to a single community, but in real-world networks, nodes are likely to belong to multiple communities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel algorithm, HqsMLCD, that can detect multiple communities for a given seed node over static networks. HqsMLCD first finds the high-quality seeds which can detect better communities than the given seed node with the help of network representation, then expands the high-quality seeds one-by-one to get multiple communities, probably overlapping.Since dynamic networks also act an important role in practice, we extend the static HqsMLCD to handle dynamic networks and introduce HqsDMLCD. HqsDMLCD mainly integrates dynamic network embedding and dynamic local community detection into the static one. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our new method HqsMLCD outperforms the state-of-the-art multiple local community detection algorithms. And our dynamic method HqsDMLCD gets comparable results with the static method on real-world networks.},

However, especially when it comes to short text documents like Tweets, these approaches often lead to unsatisfying results due to the sparsity of the document-feature matrices. Even though, several approaches have been proposed to overcome this sparsity by taking additional information into account, these are merely focused on the aggregation of similar documents and the estimation of word-co-occurrences. This ultimately completely neglects the fact that a lot of topical-information can be actually retrieved from so-called hashtag-graphs by applying common community detection algorithms. Therefore, this paper outlines a novel approach on how to integrate topic structures of hashtag graphs into the estimation of topic models by connecting graph-based community detection and semi-supervised NMF. By applying this approach on recently streamed Twitter data it will be seen that this procedure actually leads to more intuitive and humanly interpretable topics.},

Most existing network embedding methods mainly focus on static or continuous evolution patterns of microscopic node and link structures in networks, while neglecting the dynamics of macroscopic community structures. In this paper, we propose a Community-aware Dynamic Network Embedding method (short for CDNE) which considers the dynamics of macroscopic community structures. First, we model the problem of dynamic network embedding as a minimization of an overall loss function, which tries to maximally preserve the global node structures, local link structures, and continuous community dynamics. Then, we adopt a stacked deep autoencoder algorithm to solve this minimization problem, obtaining the low-dimensional representations of nodes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic networks and real networks demonstrate the superiority of CDNE over the existing methods on tackling various graph tasks.},

  abstract = {Most recent graph clustering methods have resorted to Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs) to perform joint clustering and embedding learning. However, two critical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted by learning with noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness and robustness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness. Second, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant similarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift. Interestingly, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has not yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) there is a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when clustering and reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the problem of Feature Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with vanilla auto-encoder models, due to the graph convolutional operation and the graph decoding design. Motivated by these findings, we reformulate the GAE-based clustering methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a sampling operator \$\textbackslash Xi\$ that triggers a protection mechanism against the noisy clustering assignments. Second, we propose an operator \$\textbackslash Upsilon\$ that triggers a correction mechanism against Feature Drift by gradually transforming the reconstructed graph into a clustering-oriented one. As principal advantages, our solution grants a considerable improvement in clustering effectiveness and robustness and can be easily tailored to existing GAE models.},

Although many networks contain this type of temporal information, the majority of research in network representation learning has focused on static snapshots of the graph and has largely ignored the temporal dynamics of the network. In this work, we describe a general framework for incorporating temporal information into network embedding methods. The framework gives rise to methods for learning time-respecting embeddings from continuous-time dynamic networks. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and dynamic network embedding approach as it achieves an average gain of 11.9\% across all methods and graphs. The results indicate that modeling temporal dependencies in graphs is important for learning appropriate and meaningful network representations.},

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide \$F\_1\$ scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep clustering, which is able to perform feature learning that favors clustering tasks via deep neural networks, has achieved remarkable performance in image clustering applications. However, the existing deep clustering algorithms generally need the number of clusters in advance, which is usually unknown in real-world tasks. In addition, the initial cluster centers in the learned feature space are generated by k-means. This only works well on spherical clusters and probably leads to unstable clustering results. In this paper, we propose a two-stage deep density-based image clustering (DDC) framework to address these issues. The first stage is to train a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract low-dimensional feature representations from high-dimensional image data, and then apply t-SNE to further reduce the data to a 2-dimensional space favoring density-based clustering algorithms. In the second stage, we propose a novel density-based clustering technique for the 2-dimensional embedded data to automatically recognize an appropriate number of clusters with arbitrary shapes. Concretely, a number of local clusters are generated to capture the local structures of clusters, and then are merged via their density relationship to form the final clustering result. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDC achieves comparable or even better clustering performance than state-of-the-art deep clustering methods, even though the number of clusters is not given.},

Deep clustering algorithms for anomaly detection gain significant research attention in this era. We propose an intelligent anomaly detection for extensive network traffic analysis with an Optimized Deep Clustering (ODC) algorithm. Firstly, ODC does the optimization of the deep AutoEncoder algorithm by tuning the hyperparameters. Thereby we can achieve a reduced reconstruction error rate from the deep AutoEncoder. Secondly, ODC feeds the optimized deep AutoEncoder's latent view to the BIRCH clustering algorithm to detect the known and unknown malicious network traffic without human intervention. Unlike other deep clustering algorithms, ODC does not require to specify the number of clusters needed to analyze the network traffic dataset. We experiment ODC algorithm with the CoAP off-path dataset obtained from our testbed and the MNIST dataset to compare our algorithm's accuracy with state-of-art clustering algorithms. The evaluation results show ODC deep clustering method outperforms the existing deep clustering methods for anomaly detection.},

Many researchers have worked on methods that can efficiently unveil substructures in complex networks, giving birth to the field of community discovery. A novel and fascinating problem started capturing researcher interest recently: the identification of evolving communities. Dynamic networks can be used to model the evolution of a system: nodes and edges are mutable, and their presence, or absence, deeply impacts the community structure that composes them. This survey aims to present the distinctive features and challenges of dynamic community discovery and propose a classification of published approaches. As a ``user manual,'' this work organizes state-of-the-art methodologies into a taxonomy, based on their rationale, and their specific instantiation. Given a definition of network dynamics, desired community characteristics, and analytical needs, this survey will support researchers to identify the set of approaches that best fit their needs.

We evaluate its correctness by applying it to six popular community detection algorithms on four large-scale network datasets.

We present two new social network datasets and show that by simultaneously considering the embedding and clustering problems with respect to social properties, GEMSEC extracts high-quality clusters competitive with or superior to other community detection algorithms.

Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics. These results have implications for the design of control strategies.},

We begin our analysis by constructing a 43 thousand node social graph from one thousand publicly leaked criminals' email addresses. This is done by locating Facebook profiles that are linked to these same email addresses and scraping the public social graph from these profiles. We then perform a large scale analysis of this social graph to identify profiles of high rank criminals, criminal organizations and large scale communities of criminals. Finally, we perform a manual analysis of these profiles that results in the identification of many criminally focused public groups on Facebook. This analysis demonstrates the amount of information that can be gathered by using limited data leaks.},

The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine.

  abstract = {Researchers have devoted themselves to exploring static features of social networks and further discovered many representative characteristics, such as power law in the degree distribution and assortative value used to differentiate social networks from nonsocial ones. However, people are not satisfied with these achievements and more and more attention has been paid on how to uncover those dynamic characteristics of social networks, especially how to track community evolution effectively. With these interests, in the paper we firstly display some basic but dynamic features of social networks. Then on its basis, we propose a novel core-based algorithm of tracking community evolution, CommTracker, which depends on core nodes to establish the evolving relationships among communities at different snapshots. With the algorithm, we discover two unique phenomena in social networks and further propose two representative coefficients: GROWTH and METABOLISM by which we are also able to distinguish social networks from nonsocial ones from the dynamic aspect. At last, we have developed a social network model which has the capabilities of exhibiting two necessary features above.},

The evolutionary clustering framework provides a temporal smoothness constraint for simultaneously maximizing the clustering quality at the current time step and minimizing the clustering deviation between two successive time steps. Based on this framework, some existing methods, such as the evolutionary spectral clustering and evolutionary nonnegative matrix factorization, aim to look for the low-dimensional representation by mapping reconstruction. However, such reconstruction does not address the nonlinear characteristics of networks. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm (sE-Autoencoder) to overcome the effects of nonlinear property on the low-dimensional representation. Our proposed method extends the typical nonlinear reconstruction model to the dynamic network by constructing a temporal matrix. More specifically, the potential community characteristics and the previous clustering, as the prior information, are incorporated into the loss function as a regularization term. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and superior to other methods for dynamic community detection.},

However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.},

These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods.},

The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields.

  abstract = {Detecting and tracking communities in dynamic social networks has been a grand multidisciplinary challenge. There are two key steps in tracking the community evolution of dynamic social networks, including dynamic community detection and evolutionary events identification. For dynamic community detection, incremental clustering has been used as one of the most efficient methods; however, incrementally detecting network communities may result in partition errors such that continuous error accumulation will cause a discrepancy between the computed community structure and the underlying ground-truth. For evolutionary events identification, core-node-based methods have been widely employed; however, they do not distinguish between the heterogeneous contributions of core nodes to different evolutionary events, thereby resulting in a reduced accuracy of evolutionary event identification. This paper introduces a novel two-stage method that circumvents both of these problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose an error accumulation sensitive (EAS) incremental community detection method for dynamic social networks. In our novel EAS method, rather than updating the community structure partially, a dynamic network snapshot is totally re-partitioned once the error accumulation degree of incremental clustering exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Secondly, to identify different critical evolution events, we introduce a superspreaders and superblockers (SAS) based community evolution tracking method for dynamic social networks which utilizes the properties of superspreader and superblocker nodes, the two types of core nodes related to spreading outbreaks in social networks. Experiments conducted on artificial and real-world social networks demonstrate that our proposed method can both efficiently detect dynamic network communities and accurately identify all critical evolutionary events, outperforming a total of eight competing methods. Our two-stage EAS-SAS approach could thus represent a potential method of choice for many real-world applications to community discovery and community evolution tracking in dynamic social networks.},

  abstract = {Since real-world objects and their interactions are often multi-modal and multi-typed, heterogeneous networks have been widely used as a more powerful, realistic, and generic superclass of traditional homogeneous networks (graphs). Meanwhile, representation learning (a.k.a. embedding) has recently been intensively studied and shown effective for various network mining and analytical tasks. In this work, we aim to provide a unified framework to deeply summarize and evaluate existing research on heterogeneous network embedding (HNE), which includes but goes beyond a normal survey. Since there has already been a broad body of HNE algorithms, as the first contribution of this work, we provide a generic paradigm for the systematic categorization and analysis over the merits of various existing HNE algorithms. Moreover, existing HNE algorithms, though mostly claimed generic, are often evaluated on different datasets. Understandable due to the application favor of HNE, such indirect comparisons largely hinder the proper attribution of improved task performance towards effective data preprocessing and novel technical design, especially considering the various ways possible to construct a heterogeneous network from real-world application data. Therefore, as the second contribution, we create four benchmark datasets with various properties regarding scale, structure, attribute/label availability, and etc. from different sources, towards handy and fair evaluations of HNE algorithms. As the third contribution, we carefully refactor and amend the implementations and create friendly interfaces for 13 popular HNE algorithms, and provide all-around comparisons among them over multiple tasks and experimental settings. By putting all existing HNE algorithms under a unified framework, we aim to provide a universal reference and guideline for the understanding and development of HNE algorithms. Meanwhile, by open-sourcing all data and code, we envision to serve the community with an ready-to-use benchmark platform to test and compare the performance of existing and future HNE algorithms (https://github.com/yangji9181/HNE).},

Evolutionary clustering is often utilized for the goal and has achieved some success, however, still has some major drawbacks: (1) The absence of error correction may lead to the result-drifting problem and the error accumulation problem; (2) The NP-hardness of modularity based community detection makes it low efficiency to get an exact solution. In this paper, an efficient and effective multi-objective method, namely DYN-MODPSO, is proposed, and where the traditional evolutionary clustering framework and the particle swarm algorithm are modified and enhanced, respectively. The main contributions include that: (1) A novel strategy, namely the recent future reference, is devised for the initial clustering result correction to make the dynamic community detection more effective; (2) The traditional particle swarm algorithm is improved and integrated with the evolutionary clustering framework by profitably exploiting the proposed strategy; (3) The de-redundant random walk based population initialization is proposed to diversify the individuals in a quality-guaranteed way. Furthermore, the multi-individual crossover operator and the improved interference operator are carefully designed to keep the solution from local optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on the real and the synthetic dynamic networks manifest that the proposed DYN-MODPSO outperforms the competitors in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

Community detection is the task of discovering dense groups of vertices in a graph. Its one specific form is seed set expansion, which finds the best local community for a given set of seed vertices. Greedy, agglomerative algorithms, which are commonly used in seed set expansion, have been previously designed only for a static, unchanging graph. However, in many applications, new data are constantly produced, and vertices and edges are inserted and removed from a graph. We present an algorithm for dynamic seed set expansion, which maintains a local community over time by incrementally updating as the underlying graph changes. We show that our dynamic algorithm outputs high-quality communities that are similar to those found when using a standard static algorithm. It works well both when beginning with an already existing graph and in the fully streaming case when starting with no data. The dynamic approach is also faster than re-computation when low latency updates are needed.},

BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments.

In real world, networks, like social network and biological networks, are dynamic and evolving over time. However, almost all the existing network embedding methods focus on static networks while ignore network dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning approach, DynamicTriad, to preserve both structural information and evolution patterns of a given network. The general idea of our approach is to impose triad, which is a group of three vertices and is one of the basic units of networks. In particular, we model how a closed triad, which consists of three vertices connected with each other, develops from an open triad that has two of three vertices not connected with each other. This triadic closure process is a fundamental mechanism in the formation and evolution of networks, thereby makes our model being able to capture the network dynamics and to learn representation vectors for each vertex at different time steps. Experimental results on three real-world networks demonstrate that,  compared with several state-of-the-art techniques, DynamicTriad achieves substantial gains in several application scenarios. For example, our approach can effectively be applied and help to identify telephone frauds in a mobile network, and to predict whether a user will repay her loans or not in a loan network.},
