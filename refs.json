There are many hyper-parameters to these methods (such as random walk length) which have to be manually tuned for every graph. In this paper, we replace random walk hyper-parameters with trainable parameters that we automatically learn via backpropagation. In particular, we learn a novel attention model on the power series of the transition matrix, which guides the random walk to optimize an upstream objective. Unlike previous approaches to attention models, the method that we propose utilizes attention parameters exclusively on the data (e.g. on the random walk), and not used by the model for inference. We experiment on link prediction tasks, as we aim to produce embeddings that best-preserve the graph structure, generalizing to unseen information. We improve state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of real world datasets including social, collaboration, and biological networks. Adding attention to random walks can reduce the error by 20% to 45% on datasets we attempted. Further, our learned attention parameters are different for every graph, and our automatically-found values agree with the optimal choice of hyper-parameter if we manually tune existing methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Abu-El-Haija","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Perozzi","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Al-Rfou","given":"Rami"},{"family":"Alemi","given":"Alex"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1710.09599 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,12]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Watch Your Step: Learning Node Embeddings via Graph Attention","title-short":"Watch Your Step","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09599"},

We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a framework on multiple real-world datasets, and show that it improves graph visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cavallari","given":"Sandro"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Vincent W."},{"family":"Cai","given":"Hongyun"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Kevin Chen-Chuan"},{"family":"Cambria","given":"Erik"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","DOI":"10.1145/3132847.3132925","event":"CIKM '17: ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","event-place":"Singapore Singapore","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4918-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,6]]},"language":"en","page":"377-386","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Singapore Singapore","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Learning Community Embedding with Community Detection and Node Embedding on Graphs","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3132847.3132925"},

This model is used to motivate a community-matching strategy for efficiently identifying and tracking dynamic communities.

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains.

A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem.

  {"id":"wangHeterogeneousGraphAttention2021","abstract":"Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Houye"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Chuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bai"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Yu","given":"P."},{"family":"Ye","given":"Yanfang"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1903.07293 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,20]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07293"},
  {"id":"wangVehicleTrajectoryClustering2020","abstract":"With the widely used Internet of Things, 5G, and smart city technologies, we are able to acquire a variety of vehicle trajectory data. These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Hansong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhikui"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Zhiguo"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Xiangjie"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Wei"}],"container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","container-title-short":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TITS.2020.2995856","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,12]]},"page":"1-10","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Vehicle Trajectory Clustering Based on Dynamic Representation Learning of Internet of Vehicles","type":"article-journal","volume":"PP"},
  {"id":"wuComprehensiveSurveyGraph2021","abstract":"Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks.

  {"id":"wuSageDyNovelSampling2021","abstract":"Served as an important role in numerous machine learning models, network representation learning, also known as graph embedding, aims to represent large-scale networks by mapping nodes into a low-dimensional space. However, transitional approaches mainly focus on the learning on static graphs instead of dynamic situation. Consider the broad existence of dynamic network in real world, this paper proposes a novel framework SageDy (sampling and aggregating on dynamic networks) to address the challenge in dynamic network for representation learning. In SageDy, we first propose a sampling method and a novel aggregator function to achieve high-quality representation; Then we developed two influence factors to measure the time interval influence and information upheaval influence. Finally, a temporal attention network is well introduced to model temporal information. The extensive experiments on four real-world network datasets demonstrate that SageDy could well fit the demand of dynamic network representation and significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Jiaming"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Jiangting"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Han","given":"Meng"}],"collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning – ICANN 2021","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-86383-8_1","editor":[{"family":"Farkaš","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Masulli","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Otte","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Wermter","given":"Stefan"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-86383-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"3-15","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"SageDy: A Novel Sampling and Aggregating Based Representation Learning Approach for Dynamic Networks","title-short":"SageDy","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"xuSuperspreadersSuperblockersBased2020","abstract":"Detecting and tracking communities in dynamic social networks has been a grand multidisciplinary challenge. There are two key steps in tracking the community evolution of dynamic social networks, including dynamic community detection and evolutionary events identification. For dynamic community detection, incremental clustering has been used as one of the most efficient methods; however, incrementally detecting network communities may result in partition errors such that continuous error accumulation will cause a discrepancy between the computed community structure and the underlying ground-truth. For evolutionary events identification, core-node-based methods have been widely employed; however, they do not distinguish between the heterogeneous contributions of core nodes to different evolutionary events, thereby resulting in a reduced accuracy of evolutionary event identification. This paper introduces a novel two-stage method that circumvents both of these problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose an error accumulation sensitive (EAS) incremental community detection method for dynamic social networks. In our novel EAS method, rather than updating the community structure partially, a dynamic network snapshot is totally re-partitioned once the error accumulation degree of incremental clustering exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Secondly, to identify different critical evolution events, we introduce a superspreaders and superblockers (SAS) based community evolution tracking method for dynamic social networks which utilizes the properties of superspreader and superblocker nodes, the two types of core nodes related to spreading outbreaks in social networks. Experiments conducted on artificial and real-world social networks demonstrate that our proposed method can both efficiently detect dynamic network communities and accurately identify all critical evolutionary events, outperforming a total of eight competing methods. Our two-stage EAS-SAS approach could thus represent a potential method of choice for many real-world applications to community discovery and community evolution tracking in dynamic social networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Zhiou"},{"family":"Rui","given":"Xiaobin"},{"family":"He","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhixiao"},{"family":"Hadzibeganovic","given":"Tarik"}],"container-title":"Knowledge-Based Systems","container-title-short":"Knowledge-Based Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105377","ISSN":"0950-7051","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"105377","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Superspreaders and superblockers based community evolution tracking in dynamic social networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119306264","volume":"192"},
  {"id":"yangHeterogeneousNetworkRepresentation2020","abstract":"Since real-world objects and their interactions are often multi-modal and multi-typed, heterogeneous networks have been widely used as a more powerful, realistic, and generic superclass of traditional homogeneous networks (graphs). Meanwhile, representation learning (a.k.a. embedding) has recently been intensively studied and shown effective for various network mining and analytical tasks. In this work, we aim to provide a uniﬁed framework to deeply summarize and evaluate existing research on heterogeneous network embedding (HNE), which includes but goes beyond a normal survey. Since there has already been a broad body of HNE algorithms, as the ﬁrst contribution of this work, we provide a generic paradigm for the systematic categorization and analysis over the merits of various existing HNE algorithms. Moreover, existing HNE algorithms, though mostly claimed generic, are often evaluated on different datasets. Understandable due to the application favor of HNE, such indirect comparisons largely hinder the proper attribution of improved task performance towards effective data preprocessing and novel technical design, especially considering the various ways possible to construct a heterogeneous network from real-world application data. Therefore, as the second contribution, we create four benchmark datasets with various properties regarding scale, structure, attribute/label availability, and etc. from different sources, towards handy and fair evaluations of HNE algorithms. As the third contribution, we carefully refactor and amend the implementations and create friendly interfaces for 13 popular HNE algorithms, and provide all-around comparisons among them over multiple tasks and experimental settings. By putting all existing HNE algorithms under a uniﬁed framework, we aim to provide a universal reference and guideline for the understanding and development of HNE algorithms. Meanwhile, by open-sourcing all data and code, we envision to serve the community with an ready-to-use benchmark platform to test and compare the performance of existing and future HNE algorithms (https://github.com/yangji9181/HNE).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yuxin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yizhou"},{"family":"Han","given":"Jiawei"}],"container-title":"arXiv:2004.00216 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning: A Unified Framework with Survey and Benchmark","title-short":"Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00216"},
  {"id":"zhouDynamicNetworkEmbedding2018","abstract":"Network embedding, which aims to learn the low-dimensional representations of vertices, is an important task and has attracted considerable research efforts recently. In real world, networks, like social network and biological networks, are dynamic and evolving over time. However, almost all the existing network embedding methods focus on static networks while ignore network dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning approach, DynamicTriad, to preserve both structural information and evolution patterns of a given network. The general idea of our approach is to impose triad, which is a group of three vertices and is one of the basic units of networks. In particular, we model how a closed triad, which consists of three vertices connected with each other, develops from an open triad that has two of three vertices not connected with each other. This triadic closure process is a fundamental mechanism in the formation and evolution of networks, thereby makes our model being able to capture the network dynamics and to learn representation vectors for each vertex at different time steps. Experimental results on three real-world networks demonstrate that,  compared with several state-of-the-art techniques, DynamicTriad achieves substantial gains in several application scenarios. For example, our approach can effectively be applied and help to identify telephone frauds in a mobile network, and to predict whether a user will repay her loans or not in a loan network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Lekui"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Zhuang","given":"Yueting"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"2374-3468","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,25]]},"language":"en","number":"1","source":"ojs.aaai.org","title":"Dynamic Network Embedding by Modeling Triadic Closure Process","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11257","volume":"32"}
